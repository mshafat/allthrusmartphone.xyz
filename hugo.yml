    Title: Welcome
    Content: Hi, This is Shafat M. Thanks for visiting my blog. Every day I spend a significant portion of my time on my smartphone. I know how dear and important this little device is to me and also to a lot of people like me... still it is surprising that most people are using it the same way, very shallowly... most people I meet don't know how much power it has held within... I am using it for learning, earning and productivity... over the last year I learned affiliate marketing mostly through smartphone as it was my side hustle...now as it is yielding profits every now and then... I thought it is high time to share my know-how with the world...through this blog...
