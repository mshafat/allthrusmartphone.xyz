A smartphone lifestyle focused blog authored by Shafat M. 

Slowly and steadily we are moving towards a world where our smartphones will dominate everything -- from our life to our education to our business. Through this blog, the author is going to educate and inspire Gen X, Y and Z on how to use this little workhorse for learning, earning, and productivity so that they can better prepare themselves for the future. 

Because the author believes, *"FUTURE is AllThuSmartphone"*... 

and... *"It's in YOUR Hand"* 

So, let's make it happen...
  


  


*Disclaimer: The name of the blog "All Thru Smartphone" might suggest everything talked here is done through a smartphone, but the reality is not. Although the author spend most of his time to run his side hustle through smartphone but still, some automation and foundational work requires the use of a laptop as well. If anyone asks how much of the work done through a smartphone, and with a laptop... it would be fair to say 80/20...*
