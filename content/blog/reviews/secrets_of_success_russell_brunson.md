Clickfunnel CEO, Russell Brunson is ready for his new venture. This time he is following the footsteps of Napoleon Hill. Hill was famous for his historic venture to collect success principles by intervewing successful people of his time...

Aparently Russell Brunson is going to do the same with "Secrets of Success". In this post I am going to uncover what's inside the program...

## What is "Secrets of Success"?

This is what Russell called his secret project, is basically a program where he is going to teach people about "Success". Russell himself is a successful internet entreprenure, so it is no wonder that he can teach something like this... 

The interesting thing is that Russell is leveraging Napoleon Hill who is known for the classic best-seller "Think and Grow Rich"...

At the front end of Secrets of Success is a gift box containing 3 of Napoleon Hill's books. This is what Russel shared regarding the back-story of it: 

> 2 Year's ago I become mildly obsessed with old books. I started collecting all the first editions, first printings, first manuscripts of many cools books that I could find...

Russell republished some of the books himself by partnering with Napleon Hill Foundation. He invested unbelivably crazy amount to collect pre-version galley copies of "Law of Success" from a fan of Napoleon Hill and also to get the approval from Napoleon Hill Foundation to *publish and republish* some of Napoleon Hill's unknown and unknown books...

Yeah I write it right... Rusell is going to republish some of Hill's known and unknown books for us, including some books most people have never heard before...

These are the 3 Napoleon Hill books included in the Secret of Success Kit:

1. Think and Grow Rich (New Version, Edited and Designed by Russell)
2. It Will Place You Where You Wish To Be Among Men: Practical Lessons to Applied Psychology
3. Secrets of Master Salesmanship

But this is just the front end offer, which Russel is going to giveaway for free (only pay for shipping and handling) if anyone subscribes to the "membership site"...

## Secrets of Success Membership Site
The main offer of Secrets of Success is the membership site which is based on subscription. And Russel has collected not only Napoleon Hill's unknown and unpublished books (like Hand of Destiny, Outwitting the Beasts) but also from other thought leaders that nowbody even remembers...All these will be included in the monthly subscription based membership sites which price hasn't disclosed it. But the site will feature those documents, information, training, coaching...

If anyone decides to subscribe for a year in advance, Russel has printed Nepopleon Hill's unpublished book "Hand of Destiny" and going to give a copy of the book for FREE. Russel said he collected this book from the fan of Napoleon Hill, and that guy used to charge $10,000/day just to read the book, which Russel bought from him for $5000/page! Pretty insane deal...

This is what I knew so far about the launch of Secret of Success. Currently you can only become an affilaite of the launch and promote the offer. That being said, I want to disclose that I am also an affiliate for the launch so if you decide to become an affiliate through [my link](http://www.secretsofsuccess.com/jv?afmc=4ef) I will give you access to a 6-Figure Affiliate Marketing training course designed to promote this offer mainly...This will be my bonus for you...
