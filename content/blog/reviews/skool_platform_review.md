From last week, I am seeing a disucssion emerging around an online community and course hosting platform. Many online marketers who were monetizing facebook groups are transitioning their facebook groups to that platform. And the name of the platform is **skool**. In this rview post I will try to uncover the reasons why they are doing so. Let's start...

## Facts Sheet

Although my research says skool has been around for a while (started back in 2019) as a better alternative to Facebook Group, all the recent hype on "Leaving Facebook Group for skool" started when renowned internet marketer Alex Hormozi published the following post:
![Alex Hormozi Leaving Facebook Group to Skool](/images/screenshots/alex_hormozi_skool.jpg)

In that post Hormozi says:
> **BIG Announcement** I just made the largest investment of my life into Skool.com — a platform with millions of users that makes starting your own online business simple, easy, and fun. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to make starting a business accessible to EVERYONE. And after four years…I finally found it. Skool is that opportunity. To give you an idea, users are joining Skool communities so fast that host payouts are growing by 62%...PER. MONTH. (Not a typo). If that sounds interesting...we’ve got something big coming. It involves business. Competition. Money. Prizes. And most importantly, you. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen before. You’re gonna love it. More Details to follow...stay tuned.

And after that I see more and more experienced marketers started sharing posts on transitioning their Facebook group to skool. But as a marketer I wondered what's it in for them, and for people interested in building online course and community...


When I deep dived to find out the following problems of Facebook Group:
