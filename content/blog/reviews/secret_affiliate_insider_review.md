Secret Affiliate Insider is a paid support community from Tim Ikels. Tim is a German-born digital nomad currently living in South East Asia. I have purchased Secret Affiliate Insider on June 7, 2023. Here's the screenshot of the purchase:

That means it's been nearly 1 year since I purchased it and I will try to be totally honest and neutral while writing this review. 

Before I start writing it, here's my confession...

> The Secret Affiliate Insider group is the group that helped me launch this blog site and write the reviews in honest and unbiased ways. I am a student of Tim Ikels and, although I would try to stay neutral as usual, I am asking pardon in advance for any unintentional bias that may appear as a result of human error.

## What is Secret Affiliate Insider?

As already mentioned, Secret Affiliate Insider is a paid support community on affiliate marketing. It is usually offered as an upsell for the WarriorPlus courses of Tim Ikels. It is a private server hosted on Discord where Tim Ikels and other folks hang out every day and listen & answer questions around Affiliate Marketing, Traffic, and Conversions, Reviews, etc.

## What I have found Unique in Secret Affiliate Insider Community?
I have been in this online marketing industry for the last 2 years and have been in a number of paid support communities. I have found something similar to most of these communities. There is a front-end product for which specifically these communities are usually created by the vendors. You will see a peak in engagement and support at the beginning of the launch of the product, and over time, the engagement and support starts to plummet, and after a year or two, it touches rock bottom.

Now, Secret Affiliate Insider is a rare exception in this mix. As you see, I have joined the community in June 2023, and in this 1 year, I have never seen a drop in engagement, neither from the host nor from his students. It is because the host, Tim, is not a serial product launcher. That means he doesn't launch a new product every now and then and abandon previous ones in the process. He is really focused on what he is doing and launches 1 or 2 relatively complimentary products in a year. For paid community support, he always uses the same group, **Secret Affiliate Insiders**, as an upsell. Another thing to note here is that, unlike most of the other paid support groups where I am in, the host of Secret Affiliate Insider doesn't approach this paid support community as just another product or another work. It feels like he uses the platform like his social media as an inseparable part of his online business life and journey. Therefore, I have never felt we are being abandoned in this group, ever.

## What You will Get inside Secret Affiliate Insider?
If you join Secret Affiliate Insider, you will get access to Tim Ikels, who is a very knowledgeable person I have found in this industry. He is very talented, hardworking, and an honest marketer and has a good track record to make a difference in students' affiliate marketing journey. Most importantly, he does what he teaches. Ironically, this is a trait very rare to be found in this online marketing industry. Here are some other features of the group that may attract you:

- Tim shares his journey with you every day, like what he is doing and how it can help you in your journey.
- Tim hosts live calls on a weekly or biweekly basis.
- He stays active in the group almost throughout the day, and if he stays busy for an hour or two, he announces it in advance.
- There is a co-founder of the group named Paul, who is a veteran in Solo Ads and Media Buying things. Although it feels like he prefers to stay behind the scene, I have found him answering questions if anyone asks him directly in the group.
- There is an **AI** channel where Tim shares new insights on this groundbreaking tech.
- There is a **review access** channel where there are a few products that you can access to start reviewing. This can be helpful for complete newbies.
- A **share your link** channel where other students can share links of their posts, videos, products, or anything that they found interesting to share.
- There is a **YAY** channel where Tim and other students share their wins.
- There is an **Accountability** channel, which is designed to keep students accountable to their daily action plan. I really love the idea.

## What I Don't Like About Secret Affiliate Insider?
Now I have to say, I love this group a lot, so much that I recommend every newbie who wants to learn affiliate marketing to join this group. That doesn't necessarily mean it is perfect. There are a things that I wish Tim would pay attention:

- He conducts weekly live calls, but only a handful of students participate. I am one of those who cannot participate due to the timing of the live calls. However, it wouldn't be a matter because I am mostly a passive listener. I love listening to recordings more than attending live calls. Now, there are no recordings for these live calls, which I think Tim should notice. I know it is not easy to record Discord calls, but anyway, this is something I would love to have.

## How Secret Affiliate Insider Helped me in my Journey
I am feeling lucky to have joined Secret Affiliate Insider around the second year of my affiliate marketing journey. The group was the driving force behind launching this blog under my domain. I purchased the domain six months prior, but used it to host some funnels and opt-in pages. After joining Secret Affiliate Insider, I got a new inspiration to use the domain as a blog and become a review marketer in the make money online niche. This new identity has paved the way forward and helped shape my career in affiliate marketing. I have realized that having a blog that you own is a different thing than having a Facebook or TikTok handle with thousands of followers. Those are other people's properties, but a blog is your own property. When I started this blog, I found that I got more admiration from my audience and could easily connect with other marketers just because of having this blog. Thanks to Secret Affiliate Insider and its host, Tim Ikels, for pushing me forward and inspiring me when necessary.

## Recommendation
Based on my 1-year experience in Secret Affiliate Insider and getting mentored by Tim, I highly recommend this group to newbies in affiliate marketing. I have seen most newbies get overwhelmed by lots of information and directions, not to mention, get-rich-quick schemes. All these can only prolong your odds of success. In the beginning, you need to stay focused and stay away from BS-es. This is where a private community like Secret Affiliate Insider can help, and Tim's mentorship is something that can make a true difference in your journey, just like it did with me. If you decide to experience it in first hand, here are two options to choose:
