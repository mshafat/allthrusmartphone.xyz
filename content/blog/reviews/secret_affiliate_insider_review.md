Secret Affiliate Insider is an affiliate marketing paid support community from Tim Ikels. Tim is a German born digital nomad currently living in South East Asia. I have purchased Secret Affiliate Insider on 07 June 2023. Here's the screenshot of the purchase:

That means it's been nearly 1 year when I am writing the review and I will try to be totally honest and neutral to write the review in this case. 

Before I start writing it, here's my confession...

> The Secret Affiliate Insider group is the group that helped me launch this blog site and write the reviews in honest, unbiased ways. I'm a student of Tim Ikel and although I would try to stay netural as usual, I am asking pardon in advance for any unintentional biasness if appears as a result of human error.

## What is Secret Affiliate Insider?

As already mentioned Secret Affiliate Insider is a paid support community on affiliate marketing. It is usually offerred as an upsell for the WarriorPlus courses of Tim Ikels. It is basically a Discord private server where Tim Ikels and other folks hang out everyday and listens and answers questions arround Affiliate Marketing, Traffic and Conversions, Reviews etc. 

## What I have found Unique in Secret Affiliate Insider Community?
I have been in this online marketing industry for last 2 years, and have been in a number of Paid Support Communities. I have found something similar to most of these communities. There is a front end product for which specifically these communities are usually created by the vendor. You will see a peak in engagement and support at the begining of the launch of the product and over time the engagement and support starts to go down and after a year or two it touches the rock bottom. 

Now Secret Affiliate Insider is a rare exception in this mix. As you see I have joined the community June 2023 and in this 1 year I have never seen a drop of engagement neither from the host, nor from his students. It is because the host Tim is not a serial product launcher. That means he doesn't launch a new product every now and then and abandon previous ones in the process. He is really focused on what he is doing and launches 1 or 2 relatively complimentary products in a year. For paid community support he always use the same group Secret Affiliate Insiders as an upsell. Another thing to note here is that, unlike most of the other paid support groups where I am in, the host of Secret Affiliate Insider doesn't thing this paid support community as just another product or another work. It feels like he use the platform like his Social Media as an inseparable part of his online business life. Therefore, I have never felt we are being abandoned in this group. 

## What You will Get inside Secret Affiliate Insider?
If you join Secret Affiliate Insider, you will get access to Tim Ikels who is a very knowledgable person I have found in this industry. He is a very talented, hard working, honest marketer and has a good track record to make a difference in students affiliate marketing journey. Most importantly he does what he teaches. Ironically this is a trait very rare to be found in this online marketing industry. Here's what other features of group that may attract you:

- Tim shares his journey with you every day like what he is doing and how it can help you in your journey
- Tim hosts live calls on weekly or biweekly basis. 
- He stays active in the group almost throughout the day and if he stays busy for an hour or two he announces it in advance.
- There is a co-founder of the group named Paul who he is a veteran in Solo Ads and Media Buying things. Although it feels like he prefers to stay behind the scene, I have found him answers questions if anyone asks him directly in the group. 
- There is an AI channel where Tim shares new insights on this groundbreaking tech. 
- There is a review access channel where there are a few product that you can access to start review. This can be helpful for complete newbies. 
- A share your link channel where other students can share links of their posts, videos, products or anything that they found interesting to share. 
- There is a YAY channel where Tim and other students share their wins. 
- There is an Accountability channel which is designed to keep students accountable to their daily action plan. I really love the idea. 

## What I Don't Like About Secret Affiliate Insider?
Now I have to say, I love this group a lot, so much that I recommend every newbie who wants to learn affiliate marketing to join this group. That doesn't necessarily mean it is perfect. There are a few things that I wish Tim will pay notice:

- He does weekly live calls, but only a handful of the students participate. I am one of those who can't participate due to timing of the live calls. But it wouldn't be a matter because I am most a passive listener. I love to listen recordings more than attending live calls. Now there is no recordings for these live calls, which I think Tim should notice. I know it is not easy to record Discord calls, but anyway, this is a con.
