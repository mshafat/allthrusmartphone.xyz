Properity Highway Global's website shared it's marketing message "Save Money & Make Money"  with a sub-tagline "Create Unlimited Prosperity". After some initial research I have found that it is a network marketing aka MLM opportunity. I am not into any MLM thing but my mentor suggested me to review the program with an honest perspective. Let's see if it is something that can help you achieve unlimited prosperity or it is just another short-term MLM...

But before I begin my review, I want to clear something to you. If you search on Google with "Prosperity Highway Global" you will find an international logistic company website at this name, possibly at the top. But I am not reviewing that company in this review. What I am reviewing is mainly network marketing lead generation and team building opportunity.

## Factsheet
* Name: Prosperity Highway Global (PHG)
* Founders: Ken Bolinder & Steven Schwartz
* Type: MLM/Network Marketing Tool to Promote MLM Opportunities
* Membership: $27 one-time payment
* Upsells: Funnels and many opportunities to sell


## What is Prosperity Highway Global According to Its Founders?
I have gone through one of Prosperity Highway Global's webinars and found that one of the founders Steven Schwartz says this:
> "We are not a network marketing company, but we're a tool and a system designed to allow everybody to focus on one thing, advertise one thing, market one thing, make it simple and seamless for people to join and then connect to every stream of income that you might be involved in"

So basically it is a tool and system which gives a team building system with the help of funnel. You can promote different Done-For-You Funnels from the system and track leads and conversions. Prosperity Highway Global also has call center supports to convert leads into team members. They will basically guide those leads generated by you to become a paid member like you by sharing its pre-build funnels. 

That being said, they have a funnel builder software called PHGHub. When you join with $27 one time fee you will be given access to Team Platform which will give you a "Call Center Lead Funnel" this is a funnel Steven Schwartz said to be "compliant" for every ads platforms around. By paying $27 you will also get some training articles and team communication platform. But you can't get your leads data. To get that you have to subscribe to the Basic plan at least. See what other plans it has:

## What funnels Prosperity Highway Global has to Promote?
As I said above, they give several funnels to promote to its members and it complies with the tagline shared in their website -- Save Money & Make Money. Like the two below:

- Get Paid Funnel - Entices people to join the opportunity where they can promote its product by wearing a branded T-Shirt, sharing postcards with friend and family and get money by doing so...
- Save Money Funnel: Entices people to join the opportunity to save money on solar, gas, utilities etc.

Their main motive is to let people join their system and use what they call "the duplication engine" to make money... 

They also promote their 18 year old company called "Savings Highway Global" and although I found it hard to get data on Prosperity Highway Global but this was not the case with Savings Highway Global. And I have found that many of Savings Highway Global's top earners had left the company because of frequent website crashes and other technical issues which broke their existing matrix, stopped paying for weeks and reduced their compensation all of a sudden. In my research I have found that they use an MLM software solution called Plexum to host their sites and offer these services. The Plexum software has 1.2 ratings on G2 as shown in the following screenshot:

## Final Thoughts on Prosperity Highway Global
Overall I can't recommend my audience joining any MLM and certainly not in Prosperity Highway Global. It took me considerable amount of time to understand what it actually sells. Although PHG's main USP is MLM Lead Generation and Team Building solution but the solution is based on a vulnerable platform and the reputation of the company is not up to the mark to recommend for my audience.

## My Recommendation
I recommend people to learn real affiliate marketing by providing real value to people. And I have 3 free courses that can guide complete newbies through the process. Here's the link to access those courses >> [Get 3 FREE Courses on Affiliate Marketing](https://100dfy.com/shafat)
