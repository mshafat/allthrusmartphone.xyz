Last Month I came across a new offer from a guy in Facebook. We are connected for some time and I'm also in his email list. I know what he promotes. But I have never bought anything from him. I saw him shared the offer which is priced only $2 on W+. He wrote a few lines on the benefits of the product and I also saw one commenter also gave positive feedback. Here's the exact status and the comment I'm talking about:

![The offer that brought me to Projekt 887](/images/screenshots/status_that_introduced_me_projekt_887.png "Facebook post from a marketer on Projekt 887")

![Comment from a girl on Projekt 887](/images/screenshots/comment_supporting_projekt_887.png "A girl also supported the post with a positive ocmment on Projekt 887")

So I checked the link from the comment and saw a long form sales page (which I didn't read for sure) with a Big Bold promise of giving *me* a beginner-friendly method that made the vendor of the offer **$384/day** and which I can replicate *easily* in just **30 minutes**...

And if you have been following my other reviews and reading my emails you know I get skeptical when I see sales pages try to sell on Big Bucks in Less Time... which make me feel like a so-called *Get Rich Quick Skeme* (forgive me on this type of spelling while I'm reviewing the Projekt ;) )

But still I proceed ahead and bought the projekt for $2 basically for 2 reasons...

1. It was only 2 bucks
2. There were at least 2 people who said good words regarding it


Here's my purchase receipt for Projekt 887:

Now I am going to share my honest unbiased opinion regarding Projekt 887...

## What is Projekt 887?
In short Projekt 887 is a training course that teaches affiliate marketing with mostly testing solo ads. The course includes 13 videos and was instructed by one of the vendors named Paul Prissick. While I was going through the videos I was thinking why it is named Projekt 887. I thought I won't find the answer to this question. But finally at 13th video it was touched. Paul Prissick said it took him 887 split tests to find the proven "converting" pre-frame pages that he taught in this training, so the name is Projekt 887. But why he misspelled Project still remained unanswered. 

## What Type of Affiliate Marketing is Taught in Projekt 887?
In this course Paul Prissick shared his system that he used to generate $23,18,155 from July 2019 to January 2024. Here's the proof he shared from his WarriorPlus account:
![Paul Prissick's shared his warriorplus earning](/images/screenshots/paul_prissick_warriorplus_earnings.png "Paul Prissick's Earning on WarriorPlus")

Now although I believe the above screenshot as true, but I have a BIG question whether it is affiliate earning or vendor earning. Because he clearly is a WarriorPlus vendor, so sharing his vendor results is not what I would expect in this case, because he is teaching affiliate marketing and shared the above screenshot as a proof that his method works. 

(Side Note: You may question me, what's wrong in sharing vendor earnings instead of affiliate earning when a method works for vendor it can work for affiliates too. I acknowledge this question, but here's a difference I want to address, a vendor can make sale using his team of affiliates, while an affiliate can hardly do so. So, if he teaches a method and sell the thing using a completely different approach, it wouldn't make sense to me at all. But keep reading to see what he teaches in this training...I haven't shared my final verdict yet...)

## High Converting Opt-in Page
So in order to make affiliate marketing work with this method, you must have a "high converting opt-in page". In Paul Prissick's words:
> Having a high converting opt-in page is the KEY to your success or failure.

Now here's his bold claim >> **Most of his opt-in pages convert at 60-70%.** and the reason is >> **they effectively capture the visitor's attention**. 

Now in this part he said something interesting and controversial at the same time. He said the idea of pre-framing vistors for the forthcoming offer in the opt-in page is a BS idea and those who are suggesting the idea haven't made millions with email marketing. Instead of that his suggestion is that you should "capture the lead first" and then let the "landing page" pre-frame and incentivise and then let the sales page do the selling for you. 

I'm not doing affiliate marketing at scale, so it wouldn't be justfied for me to comment on the above point. But I will share how Paul is doing email marketing soon, so stay with me...

He recommended [Systeme.io](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa00300702375afbe96ffe9694363e368653803c48) to build opt-in page which I liked. But it is interesting that what he says is not what is he doing. Let me show you what I mean and what I've found interesting...

![Paul Prissick is found to be confused about the funnel he is using](/images/screenshots/confusion_in_using_funnel_builder.png "Paul doesn't know which funnel builder he is using")

So you see he seems like totally confused on what he is talking, because he is using Clickfunnel for this course but saying all his pages are built with Systeme.io. Then he is also saying there's a link of Systeme.io *free trial* while Systeme.io doesn't have any free trial option, it has a free-forever plan that I already [reviewed in my other post](https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/reviews/systeme-io_funnel_builder_review/). 

## The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Opt-in Pages

This is the part of the course that I liked most. Prissick went through a few opt-in pages and shared his opinion regarding each. The pages that got high ratings from Paul were typically the simple, plain ones with white background. However, Paul introduced me a totally new Ai-Bot-Powered Chat-Based Opt-in Page in his presentation. This is something I have never come across previously. 

Next he also shared the exact page that helped him get 72.4% opt-in rate. I wish I could share a screenshot of the page, but I think it would be exceed the scope of a review like this. So if anyone is interested to know which opt-in page gave Paul Prissick the whooping 72.4% opt-in rate, I encourage you to purchase the product from the [sales page](https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/mmttwx/0) as it will cost only $5.95 for the front-end video series.

## How to Design a 7-Figure Landing Page 
In Paul's opt-in funnel, the page that comes after opt-in is a Landing Page. This is a page where Paul shares a review video of the product he is promoting. In the training Paul shared how to prepare the review video with complimentary bonuses so that so that the offer converts well. It was all fine up until at one point Paul publikly acknowledged that he does use fake scarcity, deadline to infuse fear of missing out to increase conversion. In his word:
> We are trying to sell stuff here right? I mean, if you are not in the business for selling stuff, you shouldn't be in the business.

I couldn't actually digest when I heard him saying the above line, so I rewinded to hear it again. And that statement made his whole offer a BS in my opinion. Because what I follow totally oppose his business philosopy:
> If you don't care values & virtues to run a business, you shouldn't be in the business ~ Shafat M. 


## Paul Prissick Recommended Traffic Sources
So in Projekt 887, Paul Prissick recommended solo ads for traffik. He said if you follow the instruction properly and create your high converting opt-in and landing pages accordingly and not-to-mention trick your audience with fake urgency, you can create a self-liquidating promo. He also gave a guide for free traffic sources, which adds zero value in my opinion as they were very short quick information, not in-depth demonstrations. 

## Paul Prissick's Email Marketing Strategy 
This is something you won't get inside the course. But as I promised at the begining of the review, I will share his so-called email marketing strategy that made him millions. And I won't have to write more on that as I have a picture that will say it all. Just see how frequently Paul emailed me after I purchased the course in February 10 and the subject lines of those email...
![Paul Prissick's spammed me with all sorts of his offers](/images/screenshots/email_frequency_and_click_bait.png "41 Mail in 6 Days from Paul Prissick")

The above screenshot were taken on 16 February, within 6 days he sent 41 emails and inside those email I have found zero value. They are all generic email promoting hosts of offers and opt-ins. I would never belief his claim that this type of strategy can make him millions with email marketing. And guess what, I unsubscribed from his list asap.

## Final Verdict
Projekt 887 is a video series where Paul Prissick shared his take on how to optimize opt-in and make sale with cold traffic. I learned a thing or two from the training and it also came with a case study. It was not bad, but I wouldn't follow a vendor who lacks values and virtues. Because this type of vendors can literally do everything to make money. Believing this type of vendor is hard for me. I don't know what you will say, but Projekt 887 is a NO from me. 

## My Recommendations
I follow a vendor on WarriorPlus who I have found trustworthy in his approach. He never sugercoate things. He doesn't use sleazy marketing tactics to make sales. If you want to experience his offers, I would suggest you start with [this free course](https://lazycommissions.com/shafat) that literally changed my views on affiliate marketing. It can change yours too...
