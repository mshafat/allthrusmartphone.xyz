Today I just come across a new offer from a guy in Facebook. We are connected for some time and I'm also in his email list. I know what he promotes. But I have never bought something from him. Today he shared the offer which is priced only $2 on W+. He wrote a few lines on the benefits of the product and I also saw one commenter also gave positive feedback. Here's the exact status and the comment I'm talking about:

![Comment from a girl on Projekt 887](/images/screenshots/comment_supporting_projekt_887.png "A girl also supported the post with a positive ocmment on Projekt 887")

So I checked the link from the comment and saw a long form sales page (which I didn't read for sure) with a Big Bold promise of giving *me* a beginner-friendly method that made the vendor of the offer **$384/day** and which I can replicate *easily* in just **30 minutes**...

And if you have been following my other reviews and reading my emails you know I get skeptical when I see sales pages try to sell on Big Bucks in Less Time... which make me feel like a so-called *Get Rich Quick Skeme* (forgive me on the spelling while I'm reviewing the Projekt ;) )

But still I proceed ahead and bought the projekt for $2 basically for 2 reasons...

1. I was only 2 bucks
2. There were at least 2 people who said good words regarding it


Here's my purchase receipt for Projekt 887:
