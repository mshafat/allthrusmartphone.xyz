![My purchase receipt of Matt Bacak's Secret Email System](/images/screenshots/secret_email_system_purchase_receipt.png "Secret Email System Purchase Receipt")

After that I dedicated an entire week to learn and understand the system. Today I am going to review it for my audience...

## Facts Sheet
- **Book Name:** [Secret Email System](https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/np11r1/0)
- **Author:** Matt Bacak, Georgia, United States
- **First Published:** 2020
- **Category:** Ebook
- **Price:** $5.60
- **Upsells:** Yes, 2 Upsells 
- **Downsells:** Yes, 1 Downsell
- **Affiliate Opportunity:** Available 
- **Commission Percentage:** 100% on Front End, 50% on Upsells


On the front end, Secret Email System is an ebook with a price tag of $5.60 with a *fake* urgency of increasing the price to $31.4 in 24 hours...(yeah the urgency is fake, so keep patience and read on)

The product sales page starts with a BIG and BOLD promise and here it goes:

> New Book Reveals How I Built A 7-Figure Online Business Using Nothing But Ethical Email Marketing To Drive Revenue, Sales and Commission...Without Ever Creating Product, Without Fulfilling Services, Without Running Ads, or Ever Doing Customer Service – And Best of All Only Working 30 Minutes A Day, All While Automatically Generating Sales 24/7

Ah, I reread it again, and found the promise is buiding a *7-Figure Online Business" putting "30 Minutes a Day". Sounds great because I can give 90 minutes to make just $50-100 each day or $1500-3000/m... it would be great if it is possible...

On top of the above BIG BOLD Promise, inside the sales page I also found the following points on why This Secret Email System is a completely Different, Unique and Secret method people haven't heard before and where the system focus to make the promise a reality:

- He doesn’t focus on *free* traffic strategies - because the reality is NOTHING is free and usually when something is FREE, the payment in the end is a lot bigger.
- He doesn’t focus on Facebook, Google, or YouTube Ads - because the algorithm changes weekly and sometimes daily - making it near impossible to build a long-term sustainable business.
- He doesn’t focus on creating our own products or services - because creating the product first is a surefire way to fail. How do you know anyone is going to buy your product in the first place?
- He doesn’t focus on building blogs, Instagram, Snapchat, or any type of social media, because anyone, anywhere at any time can do it which means if it’s easily done, then it’s not valuable or sustainable.
- He doesn’t do any content marketing - because content is useless without selling something. Who wants to create content for likes, followers, or freebie seekers
- **In fact: He rarely does anything that doesn’t make him money.**

The BIG question comes just after that, if he doesn't use free traffic strategies, if he doesn't do paid ads in Facebook, Google and Youtube, if he doesn't create his own product, staying away from blogs, instagram, snapchat, all social media, and content marketing... **what he actually does to make 7 figure?**

I suspect you are guessing this should be the "Secret" of "Secret Email System"...

Let's see how much secrets I have found there...

There are my notes from selected chapters from Secret Email System ebooks:

## Introduction: The Long, Hard Road
It doesn't include a formal introduction chapter, but I took the first few pages of the book as introduction. In those pages, Matt Bacak shared the long, hard road that everybody tells newbies to go down... and the path is as follows:

Create a product >> Create a Branding Page >> Start a Blog >> Create a Membership Site >> Spend Money on Ads 

Matt Bacak stated some big promises earlier in the chapter that the Secret Email System will be different and the best thing about the system is *it produces self-funding subcribers*

## Shocking Truth
A few cold hard truth shared in this chapter. It all started with the shocking truth
> "The shocking truth is creating a product first is idiotic, absolutely idiotic."

He also criticised the idea of following one's passion by saying "Following your  passion (blindly) is a crock of baloney"

There's a reason why he said so, and the reason is -- you have to make sale to make money -- and without understanding the demand of the product you are creating, it is a wrong step from the outset. 

It is great to have a passion for something, but you'll also need to justify the market demand for a product of your passion. After saying that Matt shared 3 cold hard truth one after the other...

First one:
> "You will become filthy rich if you go where there is market demand....Let me be blunt here, the only reason to be in the business is to make money.... The real money comes from identifying a profitable market and exploiting it to its fullest advantage"


Second one:
> "Customers do not care about you. This is something you have to understand whether you started a business or not....They want something, even if you don’t know they want it yet, that is the only thing they want from you."

The final one:
> "Leverage irresistible offer... an offer so good that people can't say no to..."

In the next chapter he shared what his Secret Email System looks like...

## Secret Email System 

According to Matt Bacak, secret email system is the easiest way to start and set yourself up for success...

And the system goes like this:

Build a List >> Mail the List >> Get Paid >> 10x it

From there, he started sharing the advices to the readers that he would give to his brother. He said, this is exactly what he would tell his brother to do if he asked him "how to start making money online?"

**1. Pick a market where there is huge demand**  
One key lesson I took from this book found here:
> "Begin with the end in mind, meaning do not sell anything unless it is something people want. The key to success is to find out what people want, go get it, and give it to them. But even better than that is find out what people buy, go get it, and sell it to them. Now the next one is this I’d tell him, sell dollars for dimes"

Yeah "selling dollars for dime" is the key take-away from the book. Matt describes in simple words how you can sell dollars for dimes... New idea worth [checking in](https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/np11r1/0)

(how to convey the value to people?)

**2. Take a shortcut by picking an irresistible offer created by someone else**

Here Matt Bacak shared how to choose best affiliate offers, especially he discussed how to evaluate Earning Per Click (EPC) to find high converting offers from affiliate marketplaces. 

**3. Sign up for the offer**

He shared 3 best affiliate networks out there today to sign up for offers in your profitable niches. 

**4. Go and buy a domain**

He taught what a domain name is and where you can register a domain name. I got nothing special from this point. 

**5. Get an autoresponder**

The reason for getting the domain is email and it is no wonder why the #5 advice is getting an autoresponder. 

**6. Desgin a pre-frame opt-in page**

Ah I made a mistake, there is another reasons for getting the domain, building an opt-in page. And he adviced to design it in such a way that prepares pre-frames the readers for forthcoming offer. So he recommended to put a thank you page after opt-in page and email 3 irresistible offer email in next 3 days after opt-in...Here he also clarified what it means by "self-funding subscribers". 

So these were the 6 advices he would give to his brother and he disclosed them all for all of us...


Now he will answer the BIGGEST question... how to get those subscribers?

## Top 7 Traffic Sources According to Matt Bacak 
Here are the 7 traffic sources Matt recommended to pursue:
1. Email Joint Ventures
2. Social Media (I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this, as I couldn't forget the big promises of the sales page)
3. Retargetting
4. Cost Per Mailing
5. Cost Per Click aka Solo Ads
6. Co-Registration
7. Article writing for Article Networks

## Money Making Mantra

Matt Bacak's Money Making Matra is Simple -- Find an Offer, Mail an Offer

But why do people will purchase more offers from you...

Matt explained by saying they would buy it anyway... if it is not from you...then it will be someone else... so whyn't just make the sale yourself?

He shared Diderot Effect in this section. French philosopher Danis Diderot lived his entire life into poverty. At the time of his daugher's marriage he needed money to pay the dowry. When the Empress of Russia, Catherine the Great, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles she offered to buy his library from him for £1000 GBP, which is approximately $63,000 USD in 2024. All of a sudden, Diderot had money to spare. But the spare money made Diderot spend for things that he didn't need. We see Diderot Effect pretty common in our daily lives. If are planning for a vacation, we buy clothes for the that, but new clothes encourages us to buy new matching shoes, matching luggages etc. So this is the reason people will buy different offers from you...

## How to 10x Your Profit

After sharing the Money Making Mantra, Matt shared his secrets to make it 10x. Matt shared several strategies including creating your own offers, offering your products with different types of media. He also gave a few tips on how to create your own offer even if you are not an expert in these fields. 

## The Last Missing Piece

So far what Matt Bacak shared is not anything new. He shared strategies to find profitable niches, ways to choose high converting affilaite offers, setting opt-in page and email autoresponder and using mostly paid traffic strategies to get email opt-in and do email marketing to make money by sending irresistible offers on a regular basis. But it is not enough to make the money.... there's one missing piece left and it is -- **action**. He said this is what makes his successful students apart from those who failed. Every one of them took action. He shared something I liked:

> Nobody has ever been paid for what they know. They get paid for what they do.

He said taking action may not make you money initially but it will give you important feedback. Take the feedback, adjust accordingly and do it again...

## How to Get Your Email Opened?
After giving you the building blocks of Secret Email System, Matt continues delivering more value on email marketing...

He discussed the importance of being purposeful about your email campaign. In this section he described how to organize your email campaign. He said:

> So your campaign should be organized based on the premise that you need to give first by providing high quality, valuable information to build credibility, and then you will receive later when your subscribers buy your products.

## How to Create Credibility with Your Subscribers?
Matt Bacak gave two tips to create credibility with email subscribers. They are:
- Be congruent in everything you say and do
- Over deliver

## How to Create Rapport with Your Subscribers?
An analogy Matt shared to make readers understand the importance of building rapport with subscribers. He said think about your day job and the salary you get paid. In our day job we serve first and then expect the company to pay. Same stands true in case of email marketing. You need to build rapport by giving value and then expect to make sale. 

Now he said there are 2 things you need to do to build rapport:
1. Give valuable information and advice first
2. Interact with them on a personal level 

In my experience I have found building rapport aka know, like, trust is a key lesson to succeed in online marketing. Matt shared the same concept here with Secret Email System. But here's the truth why most people fail to make any sale... in Matt Bacak's words:

> Most people don’t take the time to build this rapport with their list, which is why they struggle to make any sales.

First half of the book described all these fundamental concepts of interent marketing in general and email marketing in specific. The later half discussed on best practices to write effective email. 

In email marketing, there are only 2 metrics to measure - Open Rate and Clickthrough rate

Matt shared his proven strategies to write effective subject lines...like:

- Benefit Headlines
- Problem Headlines
- How-To Headlines
- Direct Command Headlines
- Question Headlines
- Offer Headlines

Learning and applying these headlines will help increase your email open rate...

Once your email gets opened, all your effort should be focused on getting the click and so you need a strong call to action. Matt Bacak shared a few examples of call to action in email...

Then Matt discussed about 4 types of email:
- Content Emails
- Free Gift Emails
- Promotional Emails
- Feedback Emails


## My Key Take Aways from Secret Email System
- I learned how to make an irresistible offer and that it is not that hard to make one
- I got 6 types of headlines that can help increase my email open rate
- Learned how to write different types of emails i.e. content emails, free gift emails, promotional emails, feedback emails
- Learned how to generate responses from your email
- Learned how to track success of my email campaign
- Learned how often should I email my list
- Learned how to put all the these together

## So What I Realized After Reading Secret Email System?
I must say I was skeptical when I went through the sales page of the book. And I was searching for ways to tell my readers where he lied in the sales page. But surprisingly I have found just a handful of mismatches between sales page and the book contents. That being said, I have to admit Matt Bacak is a very tricky and smart marketer, I would say it positively. He knows his stuff and I liked the fact he is doing email marketing to engage his list. That being said, I can confidently say making 7 figure from Email and Affiliate Marekting solely and without paying for ads is just impossible. You need to have proper lead generation system and your own offer to build a 7 figure business. What Matt Bacak said can be true for him (although I would be highly skeptical), but for 99.9% people it is just impossible. 

But still the book brings a lot of value for the readers. These are evergreen tips and strategies one need to follow to make affiliate marketing work. I love this part of the book. 

## What's Next: What are the Upsells and Downsell?
As I said in the begining, the book Secret Email System is just a front end offer. Once you complete the book and go through the bonuses included with the book, you will get some good foundation to approach affiliate marketing and email marketing the right way. After that you will need to solve your traffic problem (otherwise how would you get those subscribers to email?). And you can't solve it from the book and the bonunes. You need to know how to leverage one of the 7 paid traffic sources mentioned in the book. So Matt recommended to purchase 1st its upsell Ultimate Email Marketing Package to learn those traffic strategies...At least I have found him recommending it in his Secret Email System Checklist

![One Point of Secret Email System Checklist](/images/screenshots/secret_email_system_checklist.png)


It will cost $97 as upsell, but here's a trick, if you say "No Thanks" to the upsell you can even get it for a Downsell Price of $47. I would recommend you say "No Thanks" if you want to purchase Ultimate Email Marketing Package, it will save you money if you say "No Thanks"...

There's a second upsell after that -- Secret Email Mastermind -- and it will cost $84/year or you can again say "No Thanks" and get a second offer which will cost $9.95/m. So, yearly price will save you more money... so say no to "No Thanks" in this case...

This is how the entire funnel is structured. 


## My Recommendation

I hope you enjoyed reading my review. I tried to be as pragmatic, authentic and honest as possible. The book [Secret Email System](https://warriorplus.com/o2/a/np11r1/0) with its bonues is a bargain for the price of just $5.6, I recommend it at this price. But don't expect too much just reading the sales page.
