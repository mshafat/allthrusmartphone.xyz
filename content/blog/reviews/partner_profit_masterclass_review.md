Do you have a blog and are you thinking of ways to monetize it?

There are a few ways to monetize a blog, and if you are reading this I think you already know the two most popular ones:
1. Ads
2. Affiliate Marketing

In today's blog I'm going to review a FREE masterclass that will teach you another way to monetize your blog aka UGC Contents through Partnership. 

Let's start today's review...

## Facts Sheet

- **Category:** Blog Monetization with Brand Partnership
- **Price:** FREE
- **Upsells:** Yes, 2 Upsells. Partner Profit Kit costs $997 and 8-Week 1-on-1 Coaching price is not disclosed)

## What is Partner Profit Masterclass?
Partner Profit is a free in-depth course that teaches how to monetize a blog by partnering with brands. Roy Josfolk claims the masterclass will teach how to build a 6-figure UGC brand specifically with written content website. The course has 7 core lessons and 2 bonus lessons. Overall it will give you the knowledge to charge from brands who would like to get some brand exposure from your blog. The course will teach you several ways to charge from those brands. 

## Who's behind Partner Profit Masterclass?
Roy Josfolk is the person behind the course. He is from Orlando, Florida. I conntected with him in Facebook. We had some chitchat and he encouraged me to apply the knowledge to make some money from my blog. He sounds pretty confident that the information he has given away in this free course gonna make real money. As I am already reviewing make money online opportunities, I thought I should review the program as well. 

## What I have found inside Partner Profit Masterclass?
In the course Roy Josfolk shared how he monetized his niche blog with brand monetization. He shared the exact site that he monetized and how you can come up with a niche site like that. He showed how he finds domain name idea with ChatGPT, what tools he uses to setup the blog and how he finds brands to outreach. He basically shared everything that one need to actually make the strategy work. He only charges if anyone needs done-for-you services. I think if you are a little tech-savvy you can follow what he said and with some little Google and Youtube search you can get away with the technical challenges and also the need for the Done-For-You Kit. 

He also shared his philosophy regarding building an Independent Brand vs Personal Brand which I liked. Like this one, which you can only think of doing if you have an Independent Brand: 
> "One of the easiest ways to generate wealth for yourself and life is to create a business and exit and selling for millions of dollars"

In my research I have found that the blog site he showed as case study has good domain reputation and he is really doing this things for last 10 years as he said. I have also checked his Youtube channel and found that he is not active in Youtubing. So I can say he is doing what he is saying and is a legit guy. 

## Partner Profit in Action: What You have to Do
I want to give you a walk-through on how it may look like to work on the strategy. Here you go:
- First, you have to create a blog site based on a brand name. 
- Second, you have to put some contents and brand elements (eg. Logo) to brand your blog in a niche you are going to attracts brands to.
- Third, you have to create a pitch deck (powerpoint slide) to showcase your background, expertice, and the benefits you are bringing into the table for those brands. 
- Fourth, you have to use cold outreach strategies to reach out to potential brands and ask for free products to review. 
- Fifth, You have to review some products that you will receive from brands and then ask their testimonials to position your blog more into the niche. 
- Finally, once you are up and running with reviews and you have got some market reputations through testimonials from other brands, you will likely find more brands interested to showcase their products through you and you can then charge for writing reviews and articles on their favor.
- You have to charge small at the begining and then once your site starts getting more traffic, you can keep charging more from the brands. This is how the process works.  

## What are the Requirements to Use Partner Profit Method?
The following will be required to make Partner Profit Method work:
- A brand name which is seperate from your nick name
- A professional looking brand blogsite with a few contents. 
- Yearly costs for blog theme and hosting
- A Pitch Deck
- Cold outreach

## Pros and Cons of Partner Profit Strategy
The Partner Profit course provides a solid blog monetizaiton strategy. But it is not without pros and cons. Here are some that have come to my notice. 

### Pros
- The course is in-depth, new and pretty easy to follow. Especially I liked the structure of the course material. You will find lessons breakdowns in text format beneath every video lesson.  
- The course creator sounds legit and actually doing what he is saying. 
- The course has given all the required information for free. Giving information for free and charging for done-for-you services and support is a strategy that I like. 
- You can potentially get free products from the brands as part of following the strategy. 
- You can build back links for your site following the strategy. 
- Works great if you are using the product for yourself or for your business

### Cons
- You have to have a niche that you like and are passionate about otherwise you have to take time learning a niche. 
- You have to do cold outreach when you are begining and not many people gonna like to do it.
- You have to potentially write some free reviews for brands to get testimonials and credibility. 
- The biggest problem though for me is that you have to write only *positive* articles regarding those brands, otherwise why they are gonna spend money on you, right? I shared that concern with Roy and he said when he finds a product that is not good, he just avoid writing the reviews or mentioning their links in his articles.


## My Final Thought on Partner Profit Masterclass
After going through the entire course, I can say the course itself is pretty decent and it gave me some cool idea to monetize my blog. But again, I think the strategy will work *best* when your blog has either "TRAFFIC" or "Brand Value" otherwise there's no reason for those brands to give you money even for the exchange of backlink (sidenote: just having a backlink is not enough, it should also come from a site higher in Domain Authority). And even if you can convince a brand with first 5-6 posts that you are a niche site and you can help them get some brand exposure, I think it won't be fair. So, you can only think of using the strategy in long term. I don't find anything wrong in the strategy as long as you mention it upfront that those contents are *Sponsored Contents*. So, I recommend the course to those who are looking for alternative ways to monetize their blog.

## My Recommendation
I recommend you start a blog following my recommended course. [This course](https://lazycommissions.com/shafat) will help you understand the basics of online marketing, and it will guide you to set up and monetize a blog using "affiliate" products and product reviews. Once you launch it successfully and start getting some traffic, you can then use some of the strategies mentioned in Partner Profit Masterclass to get backlinks and mostly getting some products for review for free in exchange of backlinks and testimonials. Once you start getting more traffic from your blog then you can use Partner Profit Masterclass's other strategies to directly approach brand for possible parternships. I think it will be more helpful this way.
