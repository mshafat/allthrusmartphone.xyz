I have a soft feeling for One Lead System Pixel aka OLSP System. Because my journey in Affiliate Marketing began with this platform. The story goes like this...

I saw a sponsored ad on my Facebook which aroused my curiosity, so I clicked...
I saw Wayne Crowe for the first time and he started talking something which I couldn't realize...
So I clicked the cross button in the tab...
And an offer popped up all of a sudden...
The offer was: I can earn $20 just by completing a course
So I started the course...
And my journey with affiliate marketing began...

And obviously I earned my first $20 from affiliate marketing the same day...

So OLSP is something I am certainly greatful for...

And although I am not promoting OLSP that much in this days, I have found great value from it in my journey...

It was my plan to review OLSP a few months ago, but my mentor told me to wait for it a bit as OLSP was on the verge of a relaunch.

It relaunch in November 2023 with a brand new website and changes in its offers. Let's see what's new in OLSP, who is it for and if it is something you can make money from...

## What is OLSP? 
To me, OLSP is a biz opp platform around affiliate marketing. It teaches affiliate marketing to newbies. I have found most of its focus is on regular people wanting to make money online. And the way to make money online is mostly through promoting OLSP mega link. Previously one will get mega link upon joining OLSP for free. But in its new launch Mega Link is not free anymore. You have to purchase it with $7 to get the link. Wayne starts emailing OLSP Members after joining OLSP and you are supposed to get at least 1 email per day and sometimes several for his event promotion. He only promotes his own live calls in these emails and from the live calls other sales are made. Most of the time those are different upgrades or upsells of OLSP and the other times 3rd party products from different vendors.  

## What you will get if you join OLSP with $7?
With the new launch of OLSP you will get the following products with $7 mega link purchase. 
- Mega Link
- Facebook 101
- Comment Dominator
- OLSP User Guide
- Traffic Challenge Fast Start

## How 1 affiliate link can generate 7 different income streams? 
It is possible to generate 7+ income streams of from just 1 link -- "Mega Link"

This is how it works, people join OLSP through your Mega Link will be offered a few ways to make commissions with OLSP...

- **Mega link:** When someone you referred purchase mega link you will earn $7 (100% commission)
- **Magick Link:** With magick link you will get a similar link like mega link but this link redirects to different vendor's proudcts and opt-ins and for each Tier 1 click you will get $0.30 in commission. 
- **Comment Dominator:** You will get $0.25 for approved comment in Wayne's posts.
- **Traffic Domination Pages aka TD Pages:** A page builder which costs $47/month and contains hundreds of ready-made high converting landing pages.
- **Mega Messenger**: If you are a Facebook organic marketer, you can automate a part of your messenger outreach with this software. You have to pay $47/m to use the software. 
- **Lives:** Wayne will promote his live extensively throughout the week and in every live call Wayne will pitch something at the end be it his own coaching or other's products. Depending on the tier you are in, you can expect to get some percentage of commission if someone you referred purchase from those lives. 
- **Mega Builder:** With this new launch, OLSP Dominator has been discontinued and instead offered Mega Builders. It costs $99/m to get the benefits of Mega Builder. 
- **Team Builder:** Team Builders get everything in Mega Builders plus more support. Will discuss more on Mega Builders and Team Builders shortly. 

## Comment Dominator is now included with $7 Purchase 
So what is Comment Dominator? it is a paid way to make viral your Social Media Contents (mainly Facebook and Instagram) with comments. OLSP pays $0.25/comment. Four days ago I commented on 7 such posts and and after 4 days I have found $1.75 in my account. See the proof:

![Comment Dominator Result](/images/screenshots/comment_dominator_result.png "the commission I got from commenting on 7 posts")

Pretty easy task, all you need is click Comment Dominator Pro and scroll a little bit to check Inbox to find posts that you can comment. Then all you need is to **view** the posts available and comment there, copy the comment and then return to comment dominator and **submit** the comment.

## Mega Link Vs Magick Link 
People tend to misunderstand this but Magick link is not the same as Mega Link. You have to purchase Magick Link seperately if you want to make money with it. The price for Magick Link is $47 one-time and you will get 100 click solo ad run with the purchase. For each click to your Magcik Link from Wayne's Traffic you will earn $0.3 in commission. Yeah you have to use Wayne's traffic to get the commission. And Wayne's solo ads usually costs $0.9/click. Wayne promotes the Magick Link as List Building Training because he encourages people to get the opt-in first with TD Pages and then get the click in 2nd step. You have to configure the opt-in or squeeze page in a way that when someone opts in he/she will be redirected to a random offer through your Magick Link. 

## Magick Link's Implication to Wayne's Solo Ads Clients
Wayne is a solo ad vendor and from my research I have found that Wayne promotes his solo ad clients' offers through the Magick Link Rotators. A solo ad guy who also happened to buy solo ads from Wayne Crowe to promote a different product reported when clicked several times to Magick Link he has found Wayne rotated the link he gave Wayne to promote. 


## OLSP Upsells
Aside from the above mentioned Magick Link and Mega Link and softwares, OLSP offers some other upsells. They are discussed here: 

**Traffic Rotator:** When someone purchase Traffic Rotator for $47/month his Magic Link will be placed in a traffic rotator. This way he can build his list while getting gurranteed commission. But remember the list built that way is called "cold list" and requires time to build know, like and trust from your part. 


**Mega Builder:** Mega Builder is an upgrade OLSP offers for $99/m fee. It upgrades commissions from 3 funnels namely High Converting Megalink Funnel, List Building Funnel and Commission Generator to 50% and it also includes a funnel builder and CRM software and a Facebook Messenger Automation software called Mega Messenger. When you upgrades to Mega Builder you can then be eligible to earn high ticket commissions upto $1500. You will also get acess to weekly group coaching and support community inside OLSP. 

**Mega Team Builders:** It is designed to faciliate high ticket sale. When you pay $197/m for Team Builders you can earn commissions upto $2500 for high ticket sale inside OLSP. You get to earn big ticket commission from 3 funnels It will also provide access to MegaBuilder. So while the software will provide the automation part of the business and Wayne's team, which he claims paying $42000/m, will provide marketing, selling and closing, copywriting and customer support for the members. Another good feature is Team Builders also enjoys Two-Tier commission from Mega Link ($7) and Magick Link sale ($47) which is a whooping 200%. I will discuss how 200% commission works in details later. 


**OLSP VIP or Elite:** Inside OLSP Discover More page I saw both OLSP VIP and OLSP Elite featured as different products but they redirect to same page. This is the capstone high ticket offer from OLSP, where Wayne will work with you 1 on 1. The exact price for VIP is not mentioned anywhere but I have heard it is $5000+. 


## OLSP Commission Plan Explained

Finding OLSP Commission Plan was not an easy task for me. And it is not only me, as one buddy I talked also shared the same:
![People are Asking Questions on New OLSP Commission Plan](/images/screenshots/olsp_questions_asked.png "new OLSP commission plan revealed")


I had to dig deep as Wayne hardly mentioned this topic in his site. But I have found the following commission plan for 3 types of users 
- General Users (Those Who only purchased $7 Mega Link or $47 Magick Link)
- Mega Builders (Who are paying $99/m for Mega Builder)
- Team Builders (Who are paying $197/m for Team Builder)

And here's the commission plan for 3 different funnels:
1. **Magick Link and Mega Link Funnel**

## What You Need to Know about OLSP 200% Commission

In the new launch of OLSP, many of the affiliates are talking about 200% commissions. But many newbies can't really get the catch behind 200% commission. This is how 200% commissions work, you get 100% commission from each $7 Mega Link and $47 Magick Link sale and when you are a Mega Builder (paying $99/m) or Team Builder (paying $197/m) and you get the second tier 200% commission to mega and magick link sale of your referrals. That means Wayne will pay your referral $7 and you $14 respectively. Although the spending from Wayne seems huge on the surface, but you know the source of fund? (hint:monthly payments). That being said, I admire Wayne who likes to describe himself as Batman for the kind of audacious spending on front end for his affiliates. 


## How Good is the Support System of OLSP for $7 Front End Clients:
I have been with OLSP for 2+ years already, and I also purchased Magick Link 6 months ago. I was also a Dominator for a month. So, I just logged in to the newly launched site by requesting password recovery at login. Then I saw a few products that was already in my previous account and also Comment Dominator which wasn't in my previous account. But I didn't get access to other products that was supposed to have with $7 purchase. I asked for support using new site's Contact Us support option on bottom right. It says it will get back to me in 24 hours. Now lets see how long it took to get back to me...

![OLSP Support Responds To My Question within 12 hours](/images/screenshots/olsp_support_response.png "OLSP support found to be responsive")


 I asked for the support on 16 December 2023 at 01:00am. And they replied 16 December 2023 at 1:15pm so within 12 hours. So I can say Wayne has a good full-time team to support his affiliates. 


## Some intersting points worth mentioning about OLSP System
I have followed OLSP over last 1.5+ year and I have collected the following interesting points worth mentioning about OLSP:
- Wayne Crowe sometimes offers gifts for live attendees
- OLSP follows a loss leader strategy with its front facing offers. (in a recent training Wayne said his average loss is $50 per customer)
- OLSP pays every week on Friday and it pays via Wise or Paypal
- Wayne's team calls every person who purchase $7 front end if they put their phone number at the time of purchase. 
- Wayne uses some white label products to offer to his clients. Eg. TD Page is a white label SaaS of Wishloop and Mega Messenger is a white label of EL Messenger Pro. 

## Is OLSP Legit?
OLSP is a legit Make Money Online Business Opportunity which has been in the market for 6+ years. It has a good reputation for paying its affliate timely. I got paid my first $50 on time. So I can definately say it is a legit opportunity.  

## Is OLSP and MLM?
OLSP has 2 tier commission plan for Mega Builders and Team Builders. But it is not a pure MLM in my opinion. Because it is only 2 tier commission. To me it is just a Biz Opp around Affiliate Marketing. You can even make commission by using Magick Link and promoting its Mega Link, lives etc. and without actively engaging in team building like most MLM.


## Do I Recommend OLSP?
At the begining I said I have a *soft* feeling for OLSP, because it introduced me Affiliate Marketing for the first time, otherwise I would never know the good, bad and ugly world of affiliate marketing and couldn't meet so many awesome people and marketers around the world. So I recommend OLSP, but I would recommend it *softly*. What I mean, I would only recommend it to people interesting in Biz Opp. You can learn affiliate marketing by promoting OLSP as a business opportunity, I learned a lot from it. But understand that to make good money from it and unlock 2nd tier commission, you have to invest in mega builders or team builders. If you are the type of person, then go ahead and [join OLSP](https://olspsystem.com/join/794916).  But if you are like me, who is not biz opp type person but interested in learning affiliate marketing to make money online as a side hustle and even from your smartphone, then I have a **[clarity doc](https://rebrand.ly/clarity-doc-ats)** for you where I described how I am doing the business at present and how you can do it the right way.
