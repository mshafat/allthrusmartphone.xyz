I have a soft feeling for One Lead System Pixel aka OLSP System. Because my journey in Affiliate Marketing began with this platform. The story goes like this...

I saw an sponsored ad on my Facebook which aroused my curiosity, so I clicked...
I saw Wayne Crowe for the first time and he started talking something which I couldn't realize...
So I clicked the cross button in the tab...
And an offer popped up all of a sudden...
The offer was: I can earn $20 just by completing a course
So I started the course...
And my journey with affiliate marketing began...

And obviously I earned my first $20 from affiliate marketing the same day...

So OLSP is something I am certainly greatful for...

And although I am not promoting OLSP that much in recent days, I have found great value from it in my journey...

It was my plan to review OLSP a few months ago, but my mentor told me to wait for it a bit as OLSP was on the verge of a relaunch.

It relaunch last month with a brand new website and changes in its offers. Let's see what's new in OLSP, who is it for and if it is something you can make money from...

What is OLSP?

How 1 affiliate link can generate 7 different income streams? And 


helponomics 

Upsells:
Traffic Rotator: When someone purchase Traffic Rotator for $47/month his Magic Link will be placed in a traffic rotator. This way he can build his list while getting gurranteed commission. But remember the list built that way is called "cold list" and requires time to build know, like and trust from your part. 
Mega Team Builders: It is designed to faciliate high ticket sale. You get to earn big ticket commission from 3 funnels namely High Converting Megalink Funnel, List Building Funnel and Commission Generator. It will also provide funnel builder and CRM software named MegaBuilder. So while the software will provide the automation part of the business and Wayne's team, which he claims paying $42000/m, will provide marketing, selling and closing, copywriting and customer support for the members. 

Some intersting points worth mentioning about OLSP:
- Wayne Crowe regularly offers gifts for live attendees
- OLSP follows a loss leader strategy with its front facing offers. (in a recent training Wayne said his average loss is $50 per customer)
- But he monetizes
- OLSP pays every week on Friday and it pays via Wise or Paypal
