## Parasite Traffic Prodigy in Action
Parasite Traffic Prodigy got my interest when I found that it will teach traffic generation strategy from Reddit. Currently Reddit is on the rise as Google has made a deal with Reddit for which you will now see more Reddit user generated contents in Google's first page. So it would be nice to learn how to leverage Reddit for traffic generation, wouldn't it? 

Now let's come to the course **Parasite Traffic Prodigy**. When I was going through the course I got a little bit dishearted. My intial expectation was to learn organic traffic generation strategies through Reddit. What I have found was although organic but over the course modules it recommended a few paid options to use for the organic method to work. So here's what you will learn inside the course:

- Fergal Downe's will deliver the training module. There he recommends to join different sub reddit around your niche. For niche Fergal recommended one with high traffic. He said he has applied the strategy with Make Money Online and Weight Loss niche. 
- You will need to get high traffic Reddit posts. For that Fergal recommended a renowned SEO keyword research tool. You can use the tool for free but to follow the training you need to purchase premium plan or at least opt for 30-day trial.  
- Aside from using the SEO Keyword Research Tool, you also need to pay 2 other 3rd party services -- one for submitting your comments and the other getting upvotes into the comments. 
- You also have to purchase domain to forward your affiliate link of the related product to make it feel like you are not using affiliate link but sharing the recommended product's original link. 

## What I Liked about Parasite Traffic Prodigy
The following are the things that I liked about Parasite Traffic Prodigy:
- Parasite Traffic Prodigy is a short course. You can complete the course in one sitting and will probably take not more than 1 hour to complete. 
- Fergal went straight into the course without wasting time on long introduction or backstory things. 
- Fergal shared real opportuniy to get traffic from Reddit. 


## What I Disliked about Parasite Traffic Prodigy
Despite the above mentioned pros, I disliked Parasite Traffic Prodigy for the following reasons:
- It feels like the course was hastly made and released. The course experience can be improved if Fergal took some preparation before starting the video demonstration.
- Fergal recommended to purchase the popular keyword research tool from a 3rd party vendor in lowered price but he was not sure about that particular vendor and he never had any transaction with the 3rd party vendor. There are many scammers out there, so I can't believe Fergal recommended the vendor based on his claim only.  
- Although the course shared real opportunity to get traffic from Reddit, nowhere in his demostration Fergal showed his own results from doing the same thing. So I think what he taught is hypothetical. I would expect more real case study type demonstration instead. 

## Final Thoughts on Parasite Traffic Prodigy
Overall Parasite Traffic Prodigy is an average course that can give some food for thoughts in getting traffic from Reddit. But the vendor couldn't convince me that they are using the strategy themselves or at least couldn't share their student's results anywhere in the training. Moreover I want to add that even if the strategy is working right now I can bet that you can only follow this type of strategies on short term to get some quick win. Remember, you can't build real business following these types of strategies. 

## My Recommendations
I love to recommend what I am doing and this is what I want my audience to notice. You can find hundreds of thousands of courses teaching affiliate marketing and organic & paid traffic strategies. But you will hardly find many vendors implementing the same strategy that they are teaching. That's where my recommendations differ from the rest of the market.
