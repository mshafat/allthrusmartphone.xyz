Summary: Bobby Jones's make money online program named Cliqly is now crushing the net. But is it worth to give it a trial or is another shiny object. I'll review the result of one of Cliqly's success stories to find the truth.

> Update (15 June 2023): Aweber started blocking email containing the word "Cliqly" inside and they are *restricting* the senders accounts. Today someone who used Aweber to promote cliqly mentioned this news in a group with Awber's official statement. So beware if you are considering to use Aweber to promote Cliqly.  

I gave Cliqly a trial back in May 2023...

It was for 7 days I scheduled all my credits to earn some commission....

I earned $30+ doing so... I didn't continue with Cliqly as I was skeptical...

But I joined a growing group on Cliqly that time which is run by one of the success stories of the program...

Everyday since then I used to read messages on Cliqly from the group...

Today while I was heading toward my office...I took the chance to research on Cliqly with an intention to share with my audience...I wrote the whole post through my smartphone.... 

Here's what I have found (I rounded the figures a bit):

1. The girl who I am referring to for this review had spent 470 days in Cliqly...
2. She hit $10k after 470 days on March 2023
3. She invested roughly $9k to reach that milestone
4. And she hardly used affiliate programs to reach that level...

I salute the girl for sharing her real stats through her [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/OMo3Gwm5xgQ) (very few Cliqly affiliates will do this). But even that I feel no reason to invest my time and money on this opportunity...

My research says that Cliqly has been around for a year or two now but only recently they started offering affiliate opportunities...

Although I have an affiliate link to promote Cliqly but I won't do that as I don't believe in this opportunity and it doesn't fit my principle...

You know one of my principles is what you give is what you get...

If you are doing Cliqly all you are doing is "sending promo email to a cold list"... You don't know what those email link contains, you just promote to get $0.10 per click...If you keep doing it for long you can't develop yourself...rather you will become the promo of someone else...

I had my base in Facebook organic marketing...for my business I am in hundreds of make money online groups already... everywhere I see when someone asks for a side hustle there are people who start recommending "email marketing side hustle takes only 10 minutes a day".

I think this is the sole appeal of Cliqly...get rich quick... get rich doing nothing significant...

But to be honest, although email marketing can be a lucrative side hustle but with Cliqly, spending 10 minutes a day you can't learn a single lesson of email marketing...

As I am heading near towards my office I am gonna end up this review now...

If you want to learn real affiliate marketing I want to encourage you to get my `Clarity Doc` from top menu bar of this blog...

PS: The review is mostly based on YouTube video I mentioned above, you can check it out yourself for better understanding (don't forget to read first 3-4 comments below that video as well):
