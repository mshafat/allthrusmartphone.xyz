I am imagining a future where smartphone will replace PCs in most tasks we do at present. I see the potential of smartphone -- it can be deployed everywhere, even in remote location... I have seen many places in my country where there are people using smartphones to stay connected but we can't give a PC to those areas. 

Smartphone has got some cool advantages over PCs, for example, A PC requires a setup but a smartphone requires no setup. Even a laptop should be kept in a secure place after the work has been done, but you can keep your smartphone with you at your bed when you are sleeping. 

Another advantage of smartphone is that it is designed in such a way that is natural for most people. I have seen a lot of people taking computer courses before purchasing a computer. Like how to type, how to use mouse, and use word processors etc. But haven't single one taking a course on how to use smartphone before purchasing? You need not, because smartphone is so intuitive that even elderly people can navigate it with ease thanks to its touch and gesture based interface. 

And on top of that smartphone are so powerful, and cheap that you can buy octa core processor based smartphone is lowest prices with 4gb and 8gb rams that are commonplace even in nist under-developed countries nowadays. I know the way most people are using smartphone is not up to its potential. So I am here to share how I am using for a side husle that I started last year...

My goal is to help you learn the side hustle from reading my blog, earn from using the strategies and resources mentioned here and while doing so you stay focused and productive in your journey...

I am hopeful to find you in this journey...
