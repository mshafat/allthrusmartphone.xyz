    caption: 4 Things You Should Do to Get More from a Mentor

This is something I learned from Darren Hardy and it is very simple to understand...

But still many people fail to remember and leverage it...

In my last post I shared my take on affiliate marketing and [why it seems like magic to me](https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/about/about-author/). I wrote the post based on my conversation with a past client... 

In the same conversation, he also said that he found it difficult to understand my mentor...

Now I was following that guy very closely since he started his journey with my mentor. While it is true that finding a mentor who you understand better is cruitial for success, there's are still ways to leverage and maximize mentorship... and if you are not following the basics that I am going to discuss today, you can't just get best from a mentor. So here you go....

## How to Maximize Mentorship
### Show up
To maximize any mentorship program, you have to first show up and do it regularly...
- You have to show up on the group designed for the program...
- You have to show up on the course required for you to complete...
- You have to show up on the live calls whenever it is scheduled...

In another word, without *showing up* you cant leverage any mentorship...

### Ask
Now just showing up is not sufficient if you want to make it work...
Like my client, he did show up on group chat and in a few live calls, but unless you "ASK" you won't "GET"... So, to leverage and maximize mentorship you have to always ASK...
- Ask your questions whenever it appears..
- Ask for idea if it is difficult to come up with one...
- Ask for resources if you think you need one...

Just think how can you get the most out a mentorship if you don't ask?

### Do
On the 3rd step you have to do your part...
- Do what the your mentor recommended you to do...
- Do what you learned from showing up on the groups and calls and by asking...
- Do what you are required to do to make it happen...

The way to learn is by doing... That's what James Clear said:
> "The teacher learns more than the student. The author learns more than the reader. The speaker learns more than the attendee. The way to learn is by doing."

### Report Back
Finally you need to report back your results to your mentor and ask for his feedback and course correct your learning and actions for future... 

## Conclusion
Earlier in journey, my first mentor taught the same principle in his high ticket course by giving us a framework for operation:

> Information >> Action >> Feedback

I think this aligns with what I wrote today about maximizing mentorship. The first two step (Show Up and Ask) will help you get the "Information", and 3rd step (Do) is taking action and finally 4th step (Report Back) is sharing your results with a view to giving and receiving feedback. 

I hope this simple framework will be helpful in your journey...
