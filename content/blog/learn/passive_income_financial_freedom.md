    caption: myth around passive income and financial freedom

Summary: I shared two golden nuggets from Dan Lok's workshop I watched online... This will remove any confusion people have around passive income and financial freedom...

---

Internet marketing helped me set up my mindset as an online entrepreneur. I didn't have that mindset when I started last year. I wanted to taste financial freedom, I was alured by passive income things and when I began my journey shiny object syndrome started to kick in...

There are overwhelming amount of shiny objects in this niche. So, how did Internet Marketing helped me set up my mindset as an entrepreneur?

To be honest, there are only a handful of resources that helped me understand the fundamentals of the business. Mindset plays an important role for sure. First, [this FREE program](https://lazycommissions.com/shafat) helped me understand my shiny object syndrome and gave me the peace of mind that was needed to make this business a success...

Then someone shared me a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmNdho2svuc) of Dan Lok's workshop which helped me understand about the myth people are holding around passive income and financial freedom...In this blog I am going to dive into that...

(These are the myths Dan says blocking you from earning massive passive income)

## Myth # 1 - Financial Freedom
Most people dream to be financially free so that they don't have to do any work when they retire... this is the myth no. 1 though...!

> Financial freedom is an illusion, it doesn't exist.

Look at those billionaires we see everyday appearing in news like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, they have no shortage of money in their bank to live a financially free life but they haven't chosen to live that life by sitting on beach, doing nothing...because financial freedom is a thing sold by gurus which is an outdated things...

This is what Dan Lok said about the myth: 

> Most people don't want to retire, but they want to do what retired people want to do...

And creative people can't stay without creating things and adding value to the marketplace...

There is a mindset shift we all need to have...

> Don't aim for financial freedom, aim for financial confidence  


# Myth # 2 - Passive Income
Passive income is not a myth in the sense that it does exist unlike financial freedom... but it is a myth in the sense how people perceive this to be -- like something passive aka effortless, easy and quick...

The TRUTH is generating passive income is not easy, and it takes a lot of hard work and long time to build...

ANOTHER truth is even if you become successful to generate some form of passive income through your hard work, don't think that it would stay like this forever...

This is what Dan Lok wants us to remember:

> Just because it is passive, doesn't mean it is permanent

So even passive income is true this is not something we should think of... Dan challenges that you won't find the word "passive income" in the vocabulary of the billionaires I mentioned above...just watch some of their interviews online and try to find that word...

So in a nutshell passive income is also a myth as in reality nothing is passive.. nobody follows a passive leader... you can't achieve a good health in passive ways... anything worthwile can't be done passively...you have to work at it..

Dan poses an interesting question to all of us...

> If passive health doesn't work, passive sex doesn't work...how would passive income work?

So the lesson Dan Lok wants us to remember:

> Don't aim for passive income aim for leveraged income


The workshope is full of golden nuggets, I shared just two of them....

I highly recommend each one of you to watch the whole recording... it's going to blow your mind with values and shift your mindset...
