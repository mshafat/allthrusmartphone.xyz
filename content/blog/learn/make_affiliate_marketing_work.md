Yesterday I saw an advertisement on Facebook, which caught my attention. I remember I saw it several times, even read comments before. But today while I was reading the comments, I saw one comment clearly stood out from the rest. Although it wasn't an affiliate's comment, I took a few important lessons for my audience. Internalized properly and it can help you make affiliate marketing work, everytime...

## The Facebook Ads

Above I mentioned the Facebook ads on 7-figure email system. It is a $4.79 product, so a very cheap product in deed. Below the ads there were a lot of comments from intersted people asking different questions. But one of those comments got 60+ likes and this is where I want you to focus now...

## The Copywriter's Comment

So, exact comment that  I want you to look for is from a copywriter named Nico Sanchez. He is a copywriter who has a brand named "Copy Nomad"... and I guess he has a good reputation and following...

He purchased the $4.79 product and shared his experience in the comment:
> "initially bought this cause it it's clearly an AC funnel... gotta say as a copywriter with 10+ years experience I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality. Lots of stuff I use, but also great new stuff I want to implement." - Nico Sanchez

Nothing fancy, he just shared his experience after purchasing the product. But see three other comments after his comment... they purchased the product without overthinking... one guy asked for his further opinion... 

Now just consider the same case in the context of affiliate marketing. What if the company who advertised allows affiliate to promote their product for a commission? What if you become an affiliate of them... how should you help people make a purchase decision? 

## What Went Right? 
I want you always remember this ads and the copywriter's comment to answer the question. Because it surely worked, naturally. So there must be something gone right, let me break it down:

1. He is a professional copywriter which means he has some level of *expertise* on this
2. He *purchased* the product first of all
3. He has *gone through* the product 
4. He shared his *initial* expectation and *real* experience in *natural* language
5. The 2 people who readily bought the product must be a *follower* of the copywriter, so they have the trust on him...
6. The 3rd person who asked for further opinion, might not be following him, but he got *persuaded* by either the comment of the copywriter (he mentioned that he has 10+ years experience) or the other two people who purchased it based on the copywriter's recommendation.
7. The copywriter shared his surpsise on the *quality* of the product. 


## My Takeaways
So what's your take aways if you want to make affiliate marketing work for you?

Here's mine:
1. Gain expertise on what you are promoting, so that you can become a trusted advisor on that subject...
2. Purchase what you want to promote
3. Share your real experience with people in your own language
4. Build a following by sharing your journey and providing value
5. Tell people about you and also let your followers tell about you
6. Always promote quality products because people love to buy quality products

Hopefully the above example and takeaways were clear to you... if you need more clarity on how affiliate marketing works, then I have a `clarity doc` on the top menu bar of this site. I am sure you will find the clarity doc more insightful...
