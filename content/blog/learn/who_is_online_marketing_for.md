I see these posts often in my Facebook Feeds... Most of them are from budding affiliate marketers who started 6 months to one or two years before...

Yesterday I saw yet another post which intrigued me to write something about it...

Someone in my Facebook friend list is waiving farewell to Online Marketing. Here's what he wrote:

![A Friend Saying Goodbye to Online Marketing](/images/screenshots/a_guy_saying_goodbye_to_online_marketing.png)
The guy is saying goodbye to online marketing. It makes me sad when I see people post like this...

I understand that not everything is for everyone... 

I also felt like that as I majored in HR. I thought I am an HR mind not a Marketing mind, so initially I avoided what I thought "Marketing Specific" things like presentations, advertising etc. 

Although It was true to some extent, having the knowledge of marketing is crucial for any business success...

And Affiliate Marketing is not different. Online marketing know-how can help scale any solo business and profession when you are thinking about doing it in online medium.  

If you are an independent accountant, knowing and practicing online marketing will help you market your service and get more clients...

If you are an independent doctor with a chamber in your local...having the knowledge of online marketing especially search engine optimization can help you get more patients visits to your chamber...

If you are offering any types of products or services, knowing how to use organic and paid ads to drive traffic can be an invaluable skill in your marketing mix...

And I truly believe *you can't ignore online marketing in this age*...even if you think you are ignoring it for yourself...

You are just faking it to yourself like those people who are following "faking it till they making it" philosophy to make money online...

And I know this should not be the case...

You can do affiliate marketing without faking anything...
