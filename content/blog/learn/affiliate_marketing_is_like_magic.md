    caption: Why Affiliate Marketing Seems Like a Magic to Me
---

The other day, I was chatting with a guy I introduced affiliate marketing. I shared with him that one of his previous article is currently ranking in the 1st page of Google. But he is not doing affiliate marketing after last year...

The guys said, he thinks affiliate marketing is not for him...

And I don't have any issue if anyone says like this as I wrote clearly in [this post](https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/learn/who_is_online_marketing_for/) saying "not everything is for everyone"...

But still, I saw potential in that guy... and I believed he could make it...

Like always, we did exchange some values on affiliate marketing this time as well...

I shared my take and he shared his objections...

Nothing to sell, as he already bought something from me...

Just pure value exchange...

And I think I shared some really quality thoughts with him, which can benefit my audience as well...

Especially when I said "Affiliate marketing feels like a magic to me" I mean it...

Let me shed some lights on this...

## Why Affiliate Marketing is like a Magic to Me?
I want to share two quote to give the context...

The first one from Arthur C. Clarke, who said:
> “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”.

The second quote, I just read from a book last month and it says:
> "Familiarity breeds contempts" 

When I searched for the 2nd quote before writing this post I have found that the quote was orginally from Lucius Apuleis, The Roman philosopher, who said:

“Familiarity breeds contempt, while rarity wins admiration,” 

In today's world we can testify this statement even more... 

Just think about what you have got these days...

I would start with smartphone. To me smartphone is not less than a magic. Just think what you can do with it that our previous generations never even thought of. 

But are we really giving it the proper value it deserves? 

If we did then we would always think about all the possible ways to utilize it to its fullest...and I can tell you, very few people are doing it in this market...

Same is true for Affiliate Marketing... 

It is also no less than a magic, when I think about how fortunate I'm to get introduced with it...

Had I ever thought of making money by selling other people's product purely online?

Had I ever thought getting 100% commissions doing so?

Had I ever thought of doing a business while having a very demanding 10 hours a day, 6 days a week job?

Truth be told, I hadn't...

And to be honest, affiliate marketing gave me a real business to practice from a 3rd world country, which I never even dreamed of unless I stumbled upon on it accidentally in mid 2022...

and just with a few simple ["information product"](https://100dfy.com/shafat) and another ["simple automation suite"](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa00300702375afbe96ffe9694363e368653803c48) I am operating the business mostly from my smartphone nowadays...

On top of that, I don't have to deal with any fullfillment, any after sale service, and I am giving both of the products for *free* so that people can test it as long as they wish before they are ready to invest...

If I contemplate on all these, how can I denay that it is a lot magic that God has given in my hand in this age to leverage...considering I do it from a 3rd world country, a country most people don't know about...(thanks to Internet as well for making it happen)

But how many people gonna acknowledge this??

They say affiliate marketing is hard...

It is and I have found that the failure rate of affiliate marketing comparable to the failure rate of startup...

So, we are talking about affiliate marketing we are talking about business minus upfront costs...

And there are many ways to do this business...

You don't have to promote product on "Make Money Online" niche if you don't like to...

Last month I came across a niche site which is on "Gun Optics" and the site owner said he made $400k from the site since 2020. 

I have checked the site and found that the guy is following the same strategy that I am giving away for FREE to all my audience...

If you haven't got it yet, here's the link >> [Lazy Commissions](https://lazycommissions.com/shafat)

Now it is up to you how you are going to apply the strategy...

You can start with easy route with Make Money Online niche...

And once you gain confidence you can move on to a different niche...

But the strategy works...

You need to act and think differently...

We got so many amazing things these days that we to take them for granted, but fail to understand the power they hold within...

All you need is leverage what you have got...

And stop thinking about what you don't have...

and don't let familiarity fool you...

Success is near...

& it's in your hand...
