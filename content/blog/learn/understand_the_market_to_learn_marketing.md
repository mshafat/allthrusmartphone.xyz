In my [MMO framework](https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/learn/what_is_mmo/) I put emphasis on the importance of working on your "Mindset" in the begining of your journey...

But there are the so-called High Ticket Mindset where the gurus influence newbies to charge High Ticket for Information Products. 

They say it is all about mindset...

You will charge $9 for a product because you will have Low Ticket Mindset...

You will charge $999 for a product becaause you will have High Ticket Mindset...

I know mindset is important...

But it requires some explanation...

I mean our mind is an abstract thing...

You can put everything inside your mind and think that you are cultivating a great mindset... 

When I talked about mindset, I never mean High Ticket Mindset vs Low Ticket Mindset...

Thinking about mindset in this way is a BS to me...

I just read this post today from a budding High Ticket Marketer:
