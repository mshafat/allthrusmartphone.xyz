As I shared in the About page, I'm an open source enthusiast. I love those free and open source projects. But what it means for you? and why should you care? 

It feels so amazing that those computer scientists working in open source projects are sharing their codes with the world. If you think deeply this is a contribution in a whole different level. As I am doing affiliate marketing for last 1+ year I realized that it is our natural tendency to protect our original contents from getting copied. When I have come up with my Clarity Doc for Affiliate Marketing, I also considered to make it PDF so that no one can copy my original content. But I sticked with Google Doc to comply with the naming. I could do it because I am an open source enthusiast. That doesn't necessarily mean I am giving you rights to copy my doc. But I encourage you to contribute to the doc and make it more improved like those open source projects where there are contributors from all walks of life. You can share your improvements with me through email (shafat[at]allthrusmartphone.xyz). 

Today I want to talk about how to navigate this site...

This site uses a simple static theme called PaperMod. I don't know web coding. I only know a few HTML codes and how to set things up following tutorial. This is how I managed to build this simple static website. 

There are currently 4 categories where my writings will be classified -- Learn, Earn, Be Productive and Reviews.  To achieve to my goal for this site:  

- I will share my journey, learning, epiphanies, mindsets on general affiliate marketing with you in `Learn` section. 
- I will share Traffic and Conversion strategies in `Earn` seciton. 
- And Productivity tips and tricks will be shared in `Be Productive` section. 
- I will review Make Money Online products that I come across along my journey and will share those in `Reviews` section. 

These sections can be accessed in "Categories" page of the top navigation bar. 

I know many people nowadays are interested to explore make money online with affiliate marketing. I have shared my "Clarity Doc" on Affiliate Marketing with those people as well. You can find it as well in top navigation bar.

There is also a Search icon in the top right corner where you can find my posts based on keywords. For example, if you are wondering what my goal for the blog is... just type "goal" in search box and you will find that post...

I think you would find it easy to navigate the site...

Let me know your experience....
