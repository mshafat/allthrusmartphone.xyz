Does Email Marketing Still Work?

This is a question asked by many people but answered differently by different gurus...

Here I will say in my own opinion what I have found about email marking. You will find both two types of answers to this question. Some gurus will tell, email marketing is dead and their intention is to sell you a training on an alternative traffic and conversion strategies like paid ads, facebook organic etc. And some gurus will tell email marketing is the best thing you should do right now whereas their intention is to sell you their email marketing training. Now I have got a mixed opinion regarding this. 

I see neither of these statements is completely true and false. Email marketing is not dead at all, and it is very easy to proof my statement, just check your inbox, do you see a lot of emails on promotions? If yes, then email marketing is still alive. Now what about the other statement? I believe email marketing is not dead but also not as effective as it were 5-10 years before. While the market changed dynamically over last few years same went for marketing. As more and more people are spending more time on social platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, Discord, email marketing is becoming more harder, as your customers are most possibly spending less time on email to give time to the new social platforms. Nevertheless, email marketing is not dead, and I think it won't be dead anytime soon... There are reasons email marketing has an edge over other types of marketing and it is -- Customer Data. 

In no other platforms you own customer data. Only in email marketing you own your customers data. If you are growing your facebook group, you are building your business in Mark Zuckerberg's platform and he can ban you anytime when he feels like you are breaking a so-called community standards. So in that case you lose your business as you lose your customers from the platform. You can't even think of reaching all those people in your Facebook group with a brand new account, it is not practical and feasible. But if you get their email address, you at least have a way to recover your business. I won't say you will get 100% of those people in your Facebook group responds to your email, but you will at least have a way to find them again in Facebook and other platforms to communicate if necessary. 

Another reason why I think email keeps its appeal to marketers is its ability for automation. I know there are plugins to automate Facebook messages, and you can set certain post in your group auto post with some pre-defined rule. But it is not as simple as email automation. You can send automated email sequences to a subscriber to a list and also attribute them to a different list and sequences based on click responses. So email has its own advantage over these new platforms, and it will stay as it is in the future. Only difference is email is getting more competitive than ever. But if you look for other platforms, same stand true for all, at the begining marketing was easy, but as more time passes, it is becoming difficult. So, you have to keep yourself up to date with what' working right now in any of these cases. 

So my verdict is: Email Marketing is not dead, it is not just as easy as it was a decade before...
