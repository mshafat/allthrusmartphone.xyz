Someone asked this question on facebook, why most people fail to make money online with affiliate marketing.

Everyone who answered the question had different perspectives...

But to me there is only one way to make money online or offline...


## The the only way to make money online and offline

It is by adding value in the marketplace...

If you can add more value, you can earn more money...

Fail to understand and do it, you make zero...

Based on what I have said already, now look at the marketplace...

What most people are doing to make money online with affiliate marketing?

I see most gurus *helped* those newbies create *short form* contents for Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook and Youtube...

This is definately a skill, but look what those guys are sharing with their short form contents...

95% of them are sharing how much they made, how easy making money online is with 10 second videos and faking out a lifestyle full with freedom and luxary to lure newbies into make money online following their affiliate link...

And guess what, when someone join the program, they are taught the same strategy...

Yeah they learn some algorithm hack to get more views, interactions offcourse...

But they are using these skills to share something that adds zero value to the life of the audience they are targetting...

And on top of all these, instead of creating a value-cycle they are contributing to a vicious cycle...

Just giving you one example, 

Earlier this year I joined a popular program which has its own funnel builder software and provides traffic and conversion training as a premium serivce. 

For the funnel builder software it provides 80% recurring commissions. I saw most people in the program are promoting the funnel builder software as a *buisness opportunity* to earn 80% recurring commissions. 

But do you know who they are targeting? They are targeting only newbies interested in biz opp. I think by doing it they are creating a vicious cycle only... 

Because if they want to make good, sustainable money, best way for them was to learn how to use the software and use its potential to establish an online business eg. blog, membership site, automation, CRM etc. When they become crystal clear about the use of the software in real context, then they can confidently reach out to people who would be benefited from the kind of solution for their business. 

The irony is that, overwhelming majority of the members of the program don't know how to use the software except editing some text and adding their affiliate link in pre-made opt-in page. They only know it provides them a good opportunity through 80% recurring commission. 

See, if they knew how to use the software at its full potential, then they could certainly know who can get the benefit from the solution and they can show them the way to use the software for their leverage. Then it would create a value-cycle. 

People would stick with the software to run their businesses, and those who acted as affiliates would continue receiving 80% recurring commissions. 

But when you promote such thing as business opportunity, then people who are purchasing the software won't try to understand its benefit, rather they would try to make sale asap. And when they fail to do so, they ditch the product. I think this is not how you should do affiliate marketing...

## So what you can do if your product is an affiliate marketing training program?

I heard you, and I would admit I'm not at ease to answer this this question...

Because when what you are promoting teaches "how to promote it" then you are already in the vicious cycle and you can't ignore it...

But you can follow a strategy that I'm personally following and you can add value to your audience in this process while promoting the affiliate marketing training of your choice...
