Summary: Do you know why most people can't make money online with affiliate marketing? Because they don't know the NEW elaboration of MMO that I first introduced in this post. You can't find it anywhere else...
---

MMO aka Money Money Online is an affiliate marketing niche you may have already heard before. So, it might seem obvious when someone starts promoting make money online products or programs he/she would start making money soon. The reality is quite different though... 

On average, 95% people who starts affiliate marketing can't make money! Among the 5%, only 2% can make money consistently... 

Now this stat might discourage you or encourage you to step into affiliate marketing...

It can discourage you for the fact that only a few percentage can make real money...

It can encourage you as well if you just think that the market is not as saturated as it looks...

It is redundant to say I see the glass half-full, not half-empty. Otherwise I couldn't stick with it over last 1+ year, right?

And over the years I studied why most people can't make money with affiliate marketing...

And without further ado I am going to reveal my findings here...

> Most people can't make money because they take MMO word for word. All they want to do is *Make Money Online*, period. ~ Shafat M.

That's the reason they fail... 

- If you have seen people spamming links in groups...

- If you have found *strangers* inviting you to business opportunity...

- If you have watched those videos of people dancing and pointing fingers on how much they made money...

- If you have seen those pitch, pitch, and pitch; offers, offers, and offers everyday -- in social media, in youtube comments, in your email...everywhere...

Then you have probably seen it all...

Why they do so?

Because they want to make money online...

What's the reality? 

They make 0000

Then what should you do?

You have to keep in mind the following elaboration of MMO, always: 

* Mindset
* Method
* Opportunity

If you really want to make money online, you have to start with Mindset...

Then master a method to attract traffic and convert them into sales.

Then find the best opportunity to promote to your audience. 

The sequence is important... most people starts with Opportunity... then learn some methods to promote the opportunity... and starts pitching....skipping the mindset part alltogether...

But I want you take it sequencially, work on your mindset first and ask yourself which one you prefer -- make your first sale or help that person first. 

Then learn traffic and convesion... for best result learn it without having anything to sale... why? Because only then you can learn pure sales and marketing techniques... if you already have something to sale, you can't resist yourself to promote it, I can bet....

Then find the best opportunity you can promote... Best opportunities are those you can stand behind and promote to your friends and family... 

I think I have written enough today...
