[{"content":"Although being a student of Business Administration, I never confronted with the term \u0026ldquo;Funnel\u0026rdquo; in any marketing text books of my two universities and can\u0026rsquo;t even remember hearing the word in any of my professors lectures. But when I started my journey into Affiliate Marketing, I started hearing it from all over, from the begining till date. There are number of Software-as-a-Service Platform dedicated to offer Funnel Software for online businesses. And from the big list, I have chosen one to review in today\u0026rsquo;s post, the only funnel builder software I\u0026rsquo;m currently using for my online business automation \u0026ndash; Systeme.io\nFacts Sheet Site: Systeme.io Vendor: Aurelien Amacker, France Operating Tenure: 7+ years (apprx.) Category: Funnel Builder Free Plan: Available Upgrades: Yes, 3 Upgrade Plans Affiliate Opportunity: Available Commission Percentage: 60% Recurring What the Hack is a Funnel? Don\u0026rsquo;t conflate with the familiar old-school tube/pipe, in marketing, especially online marketing a funnel constitutes a journey a prospective customer goes through on the way to purchase. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example, suppose you provide solution to burn body fat so your prospective customers are those who are obese and wants to be lean. Your may have several products to solve the problem for your customers including equipments, workout and diet plan, training centres etc. Now you need a funnel to constitute a journey for your propective clients. You may have a few video training module on your Youtube channel from where you attract most of your customers attention to your solutions. So at the begining of the funnel is your youtube videos. If you get 1000 viewers each week then may be only 50 people may find interest to the other offers you have to solve the problem for them. You may take them to a step by step training course into a membership portal where the videos are hosted. So once those 50 people sign up to the membership portal you get their email address to contact further.Then this will be the 2nd step of your funnel. At the end of your step by step video series you may offer them some of the paid solution you have like discounts on equipments or a custom diet plan for them or you may invite them to your training centre to increase accoutability. This is how you start monetizing. But you understand that not all the 50 people will become your paid customers. May be only 10 people will readily buy one of the paid offers, what you will offer the rest? You have to have alternative solution. And this is how you build a sales funnel. Your ultimate goal is to give the transformation your clients are looking for.\nWhat is a Funnel Builder? A funnel builder is a software to aumotate the journey you are mapping for your prospective customers. For example, in the above example, the membership site can be built inside a funnel builder and set it up like that when someone subscribe to the training module he will be automatically added into an email list. Once someone is in that email list he or she will start receiving pre-designed email sequence for next 7 days. You can automate a lot of stuff using a funnel builder software. Once I will complete today\u0026rsquo;s review you will understand how to use it for your business as well. Let\u0026rsquo;s start\u0026hellip;\nSysteme.io: A funnel builder with a generous free plan and exciting affiliate opportunity So, I am using systeme.io to build my funnel. It is not only a funnel builder, it also has its own email marketing software in-built into the system. So you don\u0026rsquo;t need to use getresponse, aweber, mailchimp or any 3rd party autoresponder if you use systeme.io. To my daily use I have found it very user-friendly. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what you can do with systeme.io.\nBuild a Funnel with Systeme.io You can build awesome sales funnels using systeme.io. Once you log in to your dashboard see top menu bar and click Funnels from where you will find the Create button to start building your funnel. After that you can design your sales funnel, set automation rules, see stats and leads data into the funnel etc.\nYou can create 3 sales funnel in free version.\nEmail Marketing with Systeme.io As I said previously, Systeme.io has built-in email marketing feature. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to purchase any 3rd party software if you use Systeme.io. In my test, I have got excellant deliverabity of Systeme.io email service. I have got similar deliverabity with only Aweber. So, its inbox rate is pretty high in my opinion.\nLikewise Funnels, Email Marketing features can be accessed from top menu. You can set up automated email sequences inside Campaign section and broadcast email from Newsletters section.\nWhat I like about this email service is that you can store 2000 email addresses in systeme.io and send unlimited email to your list. You can also see the stats of your email, Systeme.io won\u0026rsquo;t restrict you from seeing your stat, even in free plan.\nWhat else can you do with Systeme.io Aside from creating sales funnel and email marketing, you can also do the following:\nCreate community (Free version allows 1 community) Set up blog (Free version allows 1 blog) Create course (Free version allows 1 course) Set up your own affiliate program What I like about Systeme.io I think Systeme.io is pretty interesting for the following reasons:\nGenerous free plan (no trial) gives people a no brainer funnel solution to test for their business 3 Paid Plans are also very affordable (costs $27/m, $47/m and $97/m) 60% recurring commission makes it a huge deal for affiliate marketers or online entreprenures (you can earn $16.2/m, $28.2/m and $58.2/m respectively from paid plan) 0% transaction fee is pretty awesome (although I am pretty sure it will set up a transaction fee at some point in the future) Unlimited Email Sending, Unlimited Students 24/7 Email Support What I don\u0026rsquo;t like about Systeme.io I have to say I love Systeme.io a lot as it is clearly following a value-first business strategy, which is how I like to do this business. But recently a pop up is featuring in Systeme.io in their homepage where I see clear inconsistency in marketing message. Below I have shared the exact pop up:\nSysteme.io Home Page clearly states it is free forever and below the pop up it is also mentioned, but the pop-up is also featuring \u0026ldquo;Limited time offer, Get Systeme.io for FREE\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how both can be true at the same time. Either it will stay free forever, or it will be paid after a while, can\u0026rsquo;t be both, in my humble opinion.\nAside from the ambiguity in marketing message, I have found everything is great in Systeme.io.\nUpdate 15/01/2024: Someone I admire a lot in this space went through my post (I\u0026rsquo;m honestly glad that he did) and remarked that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s any mismatch in saying \u0026ldquo;Limited Time\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Free Forever\u0026rdquo; at the same place. The thing is, you can grab Free Forever plan for Limited Time only, that\u0026rsquo;s the point. Which also means, those who join later may not get this plan. So, I think it is a good explanation of the promotion.\nDo I Recommend Systeme.io? Based on my review and experience of using it for last one and half year, I strongly recommend Systeme.io especially if you are looking for a funnel builder for your business, or want to build a course or community or just considering email marketing solution. You will love using Systeme.io.\nThe Next Steps So if you decide to use Systeme.io for your business, here\u0026rsquo;s my recommended next steps for you:\nStep 1: Click here to Join Systeme.io (It\u0026rsquo;s FREE)\nStep 2: Enroll and Complete Systeme.io Certification (It is FREE too)\nStep 3: Build, Automate and Enjoy\n","permalink":"https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/reviews/systeme-io_funnel_builder_review/","summary":"Although being a student of Business Administration, I never confronted with the term \u0026ldquo;Funnel\u0026rdquo; in any marketing text books of my two universities and can\u0026rsquo;t even remember hearing the word in any of my professors lectures.

Because my journey in Affiliate Marketing began with this platform. The story goes like this\u0026hellip;\nI saw a sponsored ad on my Facebook which aroused my curiosity, so I clicked\u0026hellip; I saw Wayne Crowe for the first time and he started talking something which I couldn\u0026rsquo;t realize\u0026hellip; So I clicked the cross button in the tab\u0026hellip; And an offer popped up all of a sudden\u0026hellip; The offer was: I can earn $20 just by completing a course So I started the course\u0026hellip; And my journey with affiliate marketing began\u0026hellip;\nAnd obviously I earned my first $20 from affiliate marketing the same day\u0026hellip;\nSo OLSP is something I am certainly greatful for\u0026hellip;\nAnd although I am not promoting OLSP that much in this days, I have found great value from it in my journey\u0026hellip;\nIt was my plan to review OLSP a few months ago, but my mentor told me to wait for it a bit as OLSP was on the verge of a relaunch.\nIt relaunch in November 2023 with a brand new website and changes in its offers. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what\u0026rsquo;s new in OLSP, who is it for and if it is something you can make money from\u0026hellip;\nFacts Sheet Site: OLSPSystems.com Vendor: Wayne Crowe, UK Operating Tenure: 6+ years (apprx.) Category: MMO/BizOpp Free Tier: Not Available (Minimum Tier $7 one-time) Upsells: Yes, Many Minimum Payment Threshhold: $50 Payment Hold Time: 30 days Payout Method: Paypal, Wise, Wire (in USD or GBP) What is OLSP? To me, OLSP is a biz opp platform around affiliate marketing. It teaches affiliate marketing to newbies. I have found most of its focus is on regular people wanting to make money online. And the way to make money online is mostly through promoting OLSP mega link. Previously one will get mega link upon joining OLSP for free. But in its new launch Mega Link is not free anymore. You have to purchase it with $7 to get the link. Wayne starts emailing OLSP Members after joining OLSP and you are supposed to get at least 1 email per day and sometimes several for his event promotion. He only promotes his own live calls in these emails and from the live calls other sales are made. Most of the time those are different upgrades or upsells of OLSP and the other times 3rd party products from different vendors.\nWhat you will get if you join OLSP with $7? With the new launch of OLSP you will get the following products with $7 mega link purchase.\nMega Link Facebook 101 Comment Dominator OLSP User Guide Traffic Challenge Fast Start How 1 affiliate link can generate 7 different income streams? It is possible to generate 7+ income streams of from just 1 link \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Mega Link\u0026rdquo;\nThis is how it works, people join OLSP through your Mega Link will be offered a few ways to make commissions with OLSP\u0026hellip;\nMega link: When someone you referred purchase mega link you will earn $7 (100% commission) Magick Link: With magick link you will get a similar link like mega link but this link redirects to different vendor\u0026rsquo;s proudcts and opt-ins and for each Tier 1 click you will get $0.30 in commission. Comment Dominator: You will get $0.25 for approved comment in Wayne\u0026rsquo;s posts. Traffic Domination Pages aka TD Pages: A page builder which costs $47/month and contains hundreds of ready-made high converting landing pages. Mega Messenger: If you are a Facebook organic marketer, you can automate a part of your messenger outreach with this software. You have to pay $47/m to use the software. Lives: Wayne will promote his live extensively throughout the week and in every live call Wayne will pitch something at the end be it his own coaching or other\u0026rsquo;s products. Depending on the tier you are in, you can expect to get some percentage of commission if someone you referred purchase from those lives. Mega Builder: With this new launch, OLSP Dominator has been discontinued and instead offered Mega Builders. It costs $99/m to get the benefits of Mega Builder. Team Builder: Team Builders get everything in Mega Builders plus more support. Will discuss more on Mega Builders and Team Builders shortly. Comment Dominator is now included with $7 Purchase So what is Comment Dominator? it is a paid way to make viral your Social Media Contents (mainly Facebook and Instagram) with comments. OLSP pays $0.25/comment. Four days ago I commented on 7 such posts and and after 4 days I have found $1.75 in my account. See the proof:\nPretty easy task, all you need is click Comment Dominator Pro and scroll a little bit to check Inbox to find posts that you can comment. Then all you need is to view the posts available and comment there, copy the comment and then return to comment dominator and submit the comment.\nMega Link Vs Magick Link People tend to misunderstand this but Magick link is not the same as Mega Link. You have to purchase Magick Link seperately if you want to make money with it. The price for Magick Link is $47 one-time and you will get 100 click solo ad run with the purchase. For each click to your Magcik Link from Wayne\u0026rsquo;s Traffic you will earn $0.3 in commission. Yeah you have to use Wayne\u0026rsquo;s traffic to get the commission. And Wayne\u0026rsquo;s solo ads usually costs $0.9/click. Wayne promotes the Magick Link as List Building Training because he encourages people to get the opt-in first with TD Pages and then get the click in 2nd step. You have to configure the opt-in or squeeze page in a way that when someone opts in he/she will be redirected to a random offer through your Magick Link.\nMagick Link\u0026rsquo;s Implication to Wayne\u0026rsquo;s Solo Ads Clients Wayne is a solo ad vendor and from my research I have found that Wayne promotes his solo ad clients\u0026rsquo; offers through the Magick Link Rotators. A solo ad guy who also happened to buy solo ads from Wayne Crowe to promote a different product reported when clicked several times to Magick Link he has found Wayne rotated the link he gave Wayne to promote.\nOLSP Upsells Aside from the above mentioned Magick Link and Mega Link and softwares, OLSP offers some other upsells. They are discussed here:\nTraffic Rotator: When someone purchase Traffic Rotator for $47/month his Magic Link will be placed in a traffic rotator. This way he can build his list while getting gurranteed commission. But remember the list built that way is called \u0026ldquo;cold list\u0026rdquo; and requires time to build know, like and trust from your part.\nMega Builder: Mega Builder is an upgrade OLSP offers for $99/m fee. It upgrades commissions from 3 funnels namely High Converting Megalink Funnel, List Building Funnel and Commission Generator to 50% and it also includes a funnel builder and CRM software and a Facebook Messenger Automation software called Mega Messenger. When you upgrades to Mega Builder you can then be eligible to earn high ticket commissions upto $1500. You will also get acess to weekly group coaching and support community inside OLSP.\nMega Team Builders: It is designed to faciliate high ticket sale. When you pay $197/m for Team Builders you can earn commissions upto $2500 for high ticket sale inside OLSP. You get to earn big ticket commission from 3 funnels It will also provide access to MegaBuilder. So while the software will provide the automation part of the business and Wayne\u0026rsquo;s team, which he claims paying $42000/m, will provide marketing, selling and closing, copywriting and customer support for the members. Another good feature is Team Builders also enjoys Two-Tier commission from Mega Link ($7) and Magick Link sale ($47) which is a whooping 200%. I will discuss how 200% commission works in details later.\nOLSP VIP or Elite: Inside OLSP Discover More page I saw both OLSP VIP and OLSP Elite featured as different products but they redirect to same page. This is the capstone high ticket offer from OLSP, where Wayne will work with you 1 on 1. The exact price for VIP is not mentioned anywhere but I have heard it is $5000+.\nOLSP Commission Plan Explained Finding OLSP Commission Plan was not an easy task for me. And it is not only me, as one buddy I talked also shared the same: I had to dig deep as Wayne hardly mentioned this topic in his site. But I have found the following commission plan for 3 types of users\nGeneral Users (Those Who only purchased $7 Mega Link or $47 Magick Link) Mega Builders (Who are paying $99/m for Mega Builder) Team Builders (Who are paying $197/m for Team Builder) And here\u0026rsquo;s the commission plan for 3 different funnels:\nMagick Link and Mega Link Funnel Mega Messenger Funnel Maga Builder Monthly Funnel What You Need to Know about OLSP 200% Commission In the new launch of OLSP, many of the affiliates are talking about 200% commissions. But many newbies can\u0026rsquo;t really get the catch behind 200% commission. This is how 200% commissions work, you get 100% commission from each $7 Mega Link and $47 Magick Link sale and when you are a Mega Builder (paying $99/m) or Team Builder (paying $197/m) and you get the second tier 200% commission to mega and magick link sale of your referrals. That means Wayne will pay your referral $7 and you $14 respectively. Although the spending from Wayne seems huge on the surface, but you know the source of fund? (hint:monthly payments). That being said, I admire Wayne who likes to describe himself as Batman for the kind of audacious spending on front end for his affiliates.\nHow Good is the Support System of OLSP for $7 Front End Clients: I have been with OLSP for 2+ years already, and I also purchased Magick Link 6 months ago. I was also a Dominator for a month. So, I just logged in to the newly launched site by requesting password recovery at login. Then I saw a few products that was already in my previous account and also Comment Dominator which wasn\u0026rsquo;t in my previous account. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t get access to other products that was supposed to have with $7 purchase. I asked for support using new site\u0026rsquo;s Contact Us support option on bottom right. It says it will get back to me in 24 hours. Now lets see how long it took to get back to me\u0026hellip;\nI asked for the support on 16 December 2023 at 01:00am. And they replied 16 December 2023 at 1:15pm so within 12 hours. So I can say Wayne has a good full-time team to support his affiliates.\nSome intersting points worth mentioning about OLSP System I have followed OLSP over last 1.5+ year and I have collected the following interesting points worth mentioning about OLSP:\nWayne Crowe sometimes offers gifts for live attendees OLSP follows a loss leader strategy with its front facing offers. (in a recent training Wayne said his average loss is $50 per customer) OLSP pays every week on Friday and it pays via Wise or Paypal Wayne\u0026rsquo;s team calls every person who purchase $7 front end if they put their phone number at the time of purchase. Wayne uses some white label products to offer to his clients. Eg. TD Page is a white label SaaS of Wishloop and Mega Messenger is a white label of EL Messenger Pro. Is OLSP Legit? OLSP is a legit Make Money Online Business Opportunity which has been in the market for 6+ years. It has a good reputation for paying its affliate timely. I got paid my first $50 on time. So I can definately say it is a legit opportunity.\nIs OLSP and MLM? OLSP has 2 tier commission plan for Mega Builders and Team Builders. But it is not a pure MLM in my opinion. Because it is only 2 tier commission. To me it is just a Biz Opp around Affiliate Marketing. You can even make commission by using Magick Link and promoting its Mega Link, lives etc. and without actively engaging in team building like most MLM.\nDo I Recommend OLSP? At the begining I said I have a soft feeling for OLSP, because it introduced me Affiliate Marketing for the first time, otherwise I would never know the good, bad and ugly world of affiliate marketing and couldn\u0026rsquo;t meet so many awesome people and marketers around the world. So I recommend OLSP, but I would recommend it softly. What I mean, I would only recommend it to people interesting in Biz Opp. You can learn affiliate marketing by promoting OLSP as a business opportunity, I learned a lot from it. But understand that to make good money from it and unlock 2nd tier commission, you have to invest in mega builders or team builders. If you are the type of person, then go ahead and join OLSP. But if you are like me, who is not biz opp type person but interested in learning affiliate marketing to make money online as a side hustle and even from your smartphone, then I have a clarity doc for you where I described how I am doing the business at present and how you can do it the right way.\n","permalink":"https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/reviews/wayne_crowe_olsp_in-depth_review/","summary":"I have a soft feeling for One Lead System Pixel aka OLSP System.

I saw most people in the program are promoting the funnel builder software as a buisness opportunity to earn 80% recurring commissions.\nBut do you know who they are targeting? They are targeting only newbies interested in biz opp. I think by doing it they are creating a vicious cycle only\u0026hellip;\nBecause if they want to make good, sustainable money, best way for them was to learn how to use the software and use its potential to establish an online business eg. blog, membership site, automation, CRM etc. When they become crystal clear about the use of the software in real context, then they can confidently reach out to people who would be benefited from the kind of solution for their business.\nThe irony is that, overwhelming majority of the members of the program don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use the software except editing some text and adding their affiliate link in pre-made opt-in page. They only know it provides them a good opportunity through 80% recurring commission.\nSee, if they knew how to use the software at its full potential, then they could certainly know who can get the benefit from the solution and they can show them the way to use the software for their leverage. Then it would create a value-cycle.\nPeople would stick with the software to run their businesses, and those who acted as affiliates would continue receiving 80% recurring commissions.\nBut when you promote such thing as business opportunity, then people who are purchasing the software won\u0026rsquo;t try to understand its benefit, rather they would try to make sale asap. And when they fail to do so, they ditch the product. I think this is not how you should do affiliate marketing\u0026hellip;\nSo what you can do if your product is an affiliate marketing training program? I heard you, and I would admit I\u0026rsquo;m not at ease to answer this this question\u0026hellip;\nBecause when what you are promoting teaches \u0026ldquo;how to promote it\u0026rdquo; then you are already in the vicious cycle and you can\u0026rsquo;t ignore it\u0026hellip;\nBut you can follow a strategy that I\u0026rsquo;m personally following and you can add value to your audience in this process while promoting the affiliate marketing training of your choice\u0026hellip;\nThe strategy is free so worth taking a look\u0026hellip;\nThanks for reading\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/learn/why_people_fail_to_make_money_online/","summary":"Someone asked this question on facebook, why most people fail to make money online with affiliate marketing.\nEveryone who answered the question had different perspectives\u0026hellip;\nBut to me there is only one way to make money online or offline\u0026hellip;\nThe the only way to make money online and offline It is by adding value in the marketplace\u0026hellip;\nIf you can add more value, you can earn more money\u0026hellip;\nFail to understand and do it, you make zero\u0026hellip;","title":"Why people fail to make money online"},{"content":"Clickfunnel CEO, Russell Brunson is ready for his new venture.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t have that mindset when I started last year. I wanted to taste financial freedom, I was alured by passive income things and when I began my journey shiny object syndrome started to kick in\u0026hellip;\nThere are overwhelming amount of shiny objects in this niche. So, how did Internet Marketing helped me set up my mindset as an entrepreneur?\nTo be honest, there are only a handful of resources that helped me understand the fundamentals of the business. Mindset plays an important role for sure. First, this FREE program helped me understand my shiny object syndrome and gave me the peace of mind that was needed to make this business a success\u0026hellip;\nThen someone shared me a recording of Dan Lok\u0026rsquo;s workshop which helped me understand about the myth people are holding around passive income and financial freedom\u0026hellip;In this blog I am going to dive into that\u0026hellip;\n(These are the myths Dan says blocking you from earning massive passive income)\nMyth # 1 - Financial Freedom Most people dream to be financially free so that they don\u0026rsquo;t have to do any work when they retire\u0026hellip; this is the myth no. 1 though\u0026hellip;!\nFinancial freedom is an illusion, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nLook at those billionaires we see everyday appearing in news like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, they have no shortage of money in their bank to live a financially free life but they haven\u0026rsquo;t chosen to live that life by sitting on beach, doing nothing\u0026hellip;because financial freedom is a thing sold by gurus which is an outdated things\u0026hellip;\nThis is what Dan Lok said about the myth:\nMost people don\u0026rsquo;t want to retire, but they want to do what retired people want to do\u0026hellip;\nAnd creative people can\u0026rsquo;t stay without creating things and adding value to the marketplace\u0026hellip;\nThere is a mindset shift we all need to have\u0026hellip;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t aim for financial freedom, aim for financial confidence\nMyth # 2 - Passive Income Passive income is not a myth in the sense that it does exist unlike financial freedom\u0026hellip; but it is a myth in the sense how people perceive this to be \u0026ndash; like something passive aka effortless, easy and quick\u0026hellip;\nThe TRUTH is generating passive income is not easy, and it takes a lot of hard work and long time to build\u0026hellip;\nANOTHER truth is even if you become successful to generate some form of passive income through your hard work, don\u0026rsquo;t think that it would stay like this forever\u0026hellip;\nThis is what Dan Lok wants us to remember:\nJust because it is passive, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it is permanent\nSo even passive income is true this is not something we should think of\u0026hellip; Dan challenges that you won\u0026rsquo;t find the word \u0026ldquo;passive income\u0026rdquo; in the vocabulary of the billionaires I mentioned above\u0026hellip;just watch some of their interviews online and try to find that word\u0026hellip;\nSo in a nutshell passive income is also a myth as in reality nothing is passive.. nobody follows a passive leader\u0026hellip;

Soon they realize it is not the vehicles we used to see on roads\u0026hellip;it is we people who are targeted to the offer or solution\u0026hellip;\nAfter traffic, lead generation comes into play\u0026hellip;\nThe difference I see is not clearly understood by many\u0026hellip;\nTraffic vs Lead So what is the difference between traffic and lead?\nTraffic and lead both refers to people in online marketing\u0026hellip;\nBut they are not the same, have a slight but crucial difference..\nTraffic is your target audience\u0026hellip;\nFor example, if you have a diet pill for obese people, then all the obese people online are are your target people aka traffic\nNow leads are also traffic but not all the traffic are leads\u0026hellip;\nLeads are only interested people to your offers\u0026hellip;\nFor example, you put your ads on somewhere your traffic hangs out which says you have got a pill that can help obese man and women lose 10 pounds in 30 days\u0026hellip;\nAnd you put the ads in a Weight Loss Facebook group\u0026hellip;\nThat means all the people there are your target audience aka traffic as they joined the group with an intention to lose weight\u0026hellip; If the group has 2000 members, all the 2000 people are your traffic\u0026hellip;\nBut you got only 10 people interested in your offer\u0026hellip;\nSo out of all the 2000 people you generated 10 leads who are interested in your offer\u0026hellip;\nI have written on this topic as I have been asked by many people that how to generate traffic\u0026hellip;\nThe question is wrong in my opinion\u0026hellip;\nTraffic can\u0026rsquo;t be generated, it is already there, you just need to found them\u0026hellip;\nLeads can be generated with proper ads and following proven strategies\u0026hellip;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s my take from these two terms\u0026hellip;.\nSelling vs Closing Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about Sell vs Close\u0026hellip;\nPrimarily I also thought that both terms have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably\u0026hellip;and I have seen many people use it interchangeably\u0026hellip;.\nBut then I found that they are not the same\u0026hellip; Again has a subtle but important distinction in between\u0026hellip;\nTo understand the difference I would like to recall a quote from The wolf of wall street documentary\u0026hellip; where you will hear the following Ben Affleck\u0026rsquo;s quote (which is worth remembering btw):\nA sale is made on every call you make. Either you sell the client some stock or he sells you a reason he can\u0026rsquo;t. Either way a sale is made, the only question is: Who is gonna close?\nThis quote should be understood in the context of cold calling\u0026hellip;\nIf you understand the quote you know a sale can be made without paying anything, you can sell a concept, an idea, a promise, a perspective, a logic or a reason as well\u0026hellip;and most important aspect here is that \u0026ndash; selling is a process.\nIf selling is a process, then closing is the final destination of the process\u0026hellip;if you can sell an idea, a promise etc, you can then close it by offering something irresistible to the lead\u0026hellip;.this is how you close the sell\u0026hellip;\nBut if you try to sell a big promise but the lead raises a bigger objection not to go for it\u0026hellip;.you failed to handle the objection in selling process and you failed to close and the deal is closed by the lead instead without any monetary transaction\u0026hellip;\nWhy understanding the differences is crucial? It is important to understand the differences otherwise you will struggle to prioritize your focus\u0026hellip;\nIf you are just beginning focus on how to find traffic\u0026hellip;\nWhen you got a good traffic source just focus on lead generation\u0026hellip;\nIf you become skilled at generating leads then focus more on how to sell your offer to them\u0026hellip;\nAnd if you find that your sales process taking too much time and effort and yielding less profits then surely there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong in your closing part\u0026hellip;it is time to become skilled at closing\u0026hellip;.\nSo I think the above post was helpful to understand the differences between Traffic vs Leads, Sale vs Close \u0026hellip;.\nWant more clarity like this?

Bobby Jones were the owner of the program. The VSL script of that program matches exactly with Cliqly\u0026rsquo;s. I have downloaded it from Bobby Jone\u0026rsquo;s Vimeo account and uploaded it to my Youtube. So that the proof remains on the internet even if Bobby removes the video from his account.\nUpdate (06-01-24): It is 2024, and Cliqly is still scaming people. In last October 2023 Bobby started offering 60 days of coaching for $5400 to members. But people fail to ask question why things like this require even a coaching let alone high ticket? wasn\u0026rsquo;t it as easy as sending pre-written email? Where\u0026rsquo;s the catch? Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for payments and support is not responsive at all to their queries. But you won\u0026rsquo;t hear anything like that in Cliqly Official Facebook Group. Do you know why? Because it appears that the group automatically declines comments which include words \u0026ldquo;payment\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;support\u0026rdquo;. I can easily guess Bobby\u0026rsquo;s philosophy on payment and support from this single movement. What else you can expect?\nFinal Verdict: Cliqly is 200% scam. Stay away from it before it starts massive scamming.\nLast month I made a short review on Cliqly Email Marketing side hustle. After I pushlished that post I also shared it with some folks who are promoting Cliqly. I got mixed opinion. Some of them diagreed to my findings. They told me, the girl who\u0026rsquo;s case I reviewed started at the beginning of Cliqly, but Cliqly today is not what it was back then\u0026hellip;\nBased on their feedback I realized that I have to review Cliqly once again, based on what\u0026rsquo;s currently going on there, this time I will take several examples before I give you my final thought\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s start with the factsheet\u0026hellip;\nFactsheet Name: Cliqly President: Bobby Jones Type: Investment Scheme Membership: FREE with Trial ($97 to upgrade) Trial Period: 5 days Upsells: Several What is Cliqly? According to Bobby Jones, Cliqly is doing email business. He said there are millions of people who opt-in to get offers on business opportunities etc. Cliqly is serving to those millions of people. But they can\u0026rsquo;t do it as email service providers won\u0026rsquo;t allow one single account to send billions of email to millions of subscribers list. So, they made the system where thousands of people like you and I can send email from small accounts and Cliqly shares a portion of their CPA (Cost Per Actions) commission with us. While doing my research I heard that Cliqly earns $0.35 per click into their CPA offers, and shares $0.10 with us. This is what Bobby Jones says about Cliqly. I am going to share my own opinion throughout this review.\nThe sales page video of Cliqly starts saying this:\n\u0026ldquo;Pay very close attention to every word in this video. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna walk you through the opportunity of a life-time to personally partner with me and start earning money immediately, all for free.\u0026rdquo;\nI have paid close attention to every word two times and tried to find the truth of those words. the guy talking in the video introduced himself as Gary\u0026hellip; and he also introduced 3 other success stories of Cliqly which includes Bobby\u0026rsquo;s son Christian and daughter Devin. The 3rd one nammed Brittain, who is his friend\u0026rsquo;s sister\u0026hellip; I looked all them up in Cliqly official group and through general Facebook search and couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anyone relevant, may be they have different names there, idk. But based on the sales video I am very confident that what Cliqly is claiming is not true at all.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s break it down a bit\u0026hellip;\nClaim # 1: It is 100% and completely free to get started, so you can put your wallet away\nTruth: It is free to get started: You are given a 5-day trial after which you will have to pay $97 to continue\u0026hellip; so if you put your wallet away\u0026hellip; take it back\u0026hellip;\nClaim # 2: Bobby has been working successfully online for 27 years\nTruth: I have got no trace of Bobby\u0026rsquo;s 27 years with google search, although he has a Clickfunnel Two Comma Club award. I got this Linkedin profile of Bobby Jones, but there is no photo, no information except \u0026ldquo;President at Cliqly.com\u0026rdquo;\nClaim # 3: It is completely real and completely free to get started\nTruth: So it is not completely free to get started, will talk more on that shortly\u0026hellip;\nClaim # 4: Email service provider account is limited by bandwidth and how many people you can have in your list. Email service providers don\u0026rsquo;t want paying them to take all of their bandwidth and space sending billions and billions of emails every single month.\nTruth: You are just given an account inside Cliqly, not with an Email Service Provider. So no matter how many accounts Cliqly has inside, for Email Service Provider the account holder is Cliqly. Thus, the logic of bandwidth and space is lame in my opinion.\nClaim # 5: He would love to put all of this potential customers to one huge account and email them all, but email service providers just won\u0026rsquo;t let him, no matter how much he offers to pay them.\nTruth: It is true, but there\u0026rsquo;s another truth you need to know. People are averaging $5-15 by sending 75000 email each day. If I take $10 for average that means 100 clicks for 75000 email. The click rate is 0.13%. With such low click rate no Email Service Provider gonna let him do this business.\nClaim # 6: Bobby has written two books on Email Marketing.\nTruth: I have yet to find those 2 books Bobby written. Found 2 books co-authored by Bobby Jones on Amazon but the photo of the author I saw there is a black man\u0026rsquo;s who is clearly a different person.\nClaim # 7: Because of the enormous size of the email market, there\u0026rsquo;s no limit except for the fact that Bobby can only work with a limited number of people\u0026hellip;\nTruth: This can be partially true that the size of email market is big, but there are rules of doing business there. You can\u0026rsquo;t spam offers to a list even if they have given their consent to do so. Because if your open rate and click rate is super low, no email service provider will allow you to keep sending emails for life. Interestingly Aweber started restricting accounts those are promoting Cliqly. So, I believe what Cliqly is saying and doing is further from truth.\nClaim # 8: Bobby wants you to partner with him. Notice \u0026ldquo;Parnter\u0026rdquo; not \u0026ldquo;Pay\u0026rdquo;. You would never pay him a single dime ever for any of his trainings and knowledge that he has aquired in last 27 years.\nTruth: A blatant lie. Bobby requires you to pay money or stay away.\nClaim # 9: In fact, he is gonna pay you. He will make money when you will make money.\nTruth: This is 100% true, he will make money when you will make money. The difference is you will need to pay him more than you payout\u0026hellip;\nGetting started with Cliqly is FREE, but only for 5 days If you join Cliqly you will start with a 5-day FREE trial membership, where you will be given a 5000 email list to email. You can send email with Cliqly credits and there are two types of credits:\nCliqly list building credits: Whenever you send email with List Building Credits and someone opens your email that subscriber\u0026rsquo;s email will be added to your existing 5000 openers list. That means you are building your list by each open. You can send and schedule email in a batch of 20,000 and sending limit is 40,000 each day.\nCliqlyPro credits: When you signed up, you will be given a 5000 openers list and 500,000 CliqlyPro credits to send email to the list. With 1 credit you can send 1 email and it will earn you $0.10 when someone clicks on the link. You can send and schedule emails in batches of 5,000 and sending limit is 75,000 each day. Sending limits will increase with the upgrade of Tier. Will talk about the tier later on.\nIs Cliqly FREE? Because you are not providing your card details at the time of sign up, Cliqly won\u0026rsquo;t cost you anything to start, but you can\u0026rsquo;t actually go anywhere with this trial. You have to pay $97 to keep using it after the trial or you can\u0026rsquo;t withdraw your commission. With the purchase of $97 will give you an additional 500,000 CliqlyPro Credits and an additional 200,000 List Building credits. You have to keep purchasing these credits if you continue sending emails on a regular basis otherwise the credits will run out and your journey will stop.\nThreshold to withdraw commissions in Cliqly It is very important to note that paying $97 will make you eligible to withdraw your commission earned but there is another condition to be met to withdraw your commission \u0026ndash; Minimum Threshold. The minimum threshhold of withdrawal is a whooping $300. So, untill you reach that threshold don\u0026rsquo;t think of seeing the commission in your bank account.\nCliqly tiers explained (Tier 1 to 10) Cliqly Tiers are based on how many subcribers or openers list you have and it is important because you can send more emails per day if you are in higher tier\u0026hellip; here\u0026rsquo;s the Tier brakdowns:\nTier 1 (Openers List UP TO 30,000): Send upto 70,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 2 (Openers List OVER 30,000): Send upto 100,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 3 (Openers List OVER 70,000): Send upto 130,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 4 (Openers List OVER 100,000): Send upto 200,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 5 (Openers List OVER 150,000): Send upto 250,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 6 (Openers List OVER 250,000): Send upto 350,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 7 (Openers List OVER 350,000): Send upto 500,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 8 (Openers List OVER 500,000): Send upto 650,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 9 (Openers List OVER 700,000): Send upto 800,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 10 (Openers List OVER 900,000): Send upto 1,000,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro There are several upsells in Cliqly Aside from paying for credits, there are upsells and flash sells inside Cliqly, three of them are mentioned below:\nTier Jumper: Occaisionally they offer this upsell, where you can buy 10k, 25k, and 50k subscribers list and jump your tier.\nMyInboxPro: With MyInBoxPro you can send your own offer and write your own email. There are several packages. Starter package costs $97/month. With $97/month you can send 30,000 email each day to promote your own offer to your openers list.\nCo-Op: With Co-Op program Cliqly also promotes your affilites link and guarantees referral. Eg. It takes $197 to get 20 referrals.\nWhy the hype around Cliqly? So, with everything I have discussed above, the big question can be what\u0026rsquo;s the reason for the Cliqly hype lately, here\u0026rsquo;s the short answer: Affiliate Commission.\nCliqly affiliate commission If someone you referred to Cliqly upgrades with $97 you will get 100% commission of that. You will get 5% commission for fothcoming purchases of credits and other upsells. That\u0026rsquo;s all about the affiliate program so far. In fact, to me except the 100% commission of $97, the commission plan is not interesting at all.\nI have even a better opportunity which is completely free on front end and if you pay for special license you can receive 100% commission on all the current upsells.\nWho are the target customer of Cliqly? I have found some common characteristics of people who are using Cliqly:\nMost people who are using Cliqly are newbies to make money online Most of them don\u0026rsquo;t have any technical know-how to operate a business online Many of them don\u0026rsquo;t want to put the time and effort required when it comes to make money online Finally they have idle money to invest Cliqly has given a lot of these people the first hand experience to make money online. You start the trial, send the emails in 5 to 10 minutes and after 24 hours you see $5-15 in your account. Which has a great impact on people\u0026rsquo;s psychology to invest into the system.\nIs Cliqly a scam? If I consider the sales video, Cliqly is a total scam. But in terms of paying the eligible customers their commission, it is not a scam, at least not yet. But to be honest, I am highly skeptical of this business, it makes no sense to me and if my 6th sense is right Cliqly will stop paying sooner or later or FTC will ban the business.\nWho is Cliqly for? Cliqly is for you:\nIf you have never made money online, but want to get the feeling of it. If you are reluctant to learn high income skills to make money online. If you are not motivated to do income producing activity to run a real online business. If you have spere money to spend in a so called \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; investment scheme with little work committment. If you have never heard of 100% commission online and are thinking it is only Cliqly which is offering this. If you are not like above, check out this learning opportunity which is free on front end and also gives you 100% commission on upsells with special license.\nThis is what I have found after talking with those who are using Cliqly? I have talked with a few folks in Cliqly, most of those people are not in profit with the system, a few of those are in profit. One guy is earning $1500 every week with the system. Putting them all together here are some key insights of it:\nThe list Cliqly is giving to people are only responsive inside the system Even if you email from Cliqly but you change the link containing in the pre-written email to your own offer, the click rate will suddenly fall down to zero. The click rate is down from July and August and Bobby said it is because of the summar time in US and because most people are spending their holiday. Those people who are using Cliqly for last 2 years said that \u0026ldquo;summar fall\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t happen last year, at least not in July and August. Other people reported no matter what time you spread your email to be sent, you always get the average clicks. This would not be the case if the list is US dominant. Bobby said he is giving $0.10 click commission out of kindness. This statement blows Email Service Providers logic out of the water. Some people who are using Cliqly started getting the mass generic pre-written email from other users and even their own email as well. It slightly proves that Cliqly is indeed delivering some of the emails, but how much and who\u0026rsquo;s? The support system of Cliqly is not responsive. You may have to email them several times to get a response. Finally one guy who is currently in profit with Cliqly (staying from the begining) gave a remark on Cliqly list building and I think the same remark applies to Cliqly in general \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;it is just another game of chance\u0026rdquo;. Final thought Cliqly is not an email marketing business. It is just an investment scheme in disguise of email marketing or CPA marketing. It feels more like a Ponzy scheme which is defined as: A form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.\nMy recommendation For obvious reasons, I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend and promote Cliqly although I know it is easier to sell this type of opportunity to a large pool of audience. I like to make money by helping people, recommending people what is good for them. And if you think the above review was helpful in some way, then I must have done something right.

According to Bobby Jones, Cliqly is an Email Business. In this in-depth review I have shared my honest opinion on what Cliqly really is and what it is not\u0026hellip;","title":"My in depth review on Bobby Jones's Cliqly aka Turnkeymailbiz"},{"content":"Yesterday I saw an advertisement on Facebook, which caught my attention. I remember I saw it several times, even read comments before. But today while I was reading the comments, I saw one comment clearly stood out from the rest. Although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t an affiliate\u0026rsquo;s comment, I took a few important lessons for my audience. Internalized properly and it can help you make affiliate marketing work, everytime\u0026hellip;\nThe Facebook Ads Above I mentioned the Facebook ads on 7-figure email system. It is a $4.79 product, so a very cheap product in deed. Below the ads there were a lot of comments from intersted people asking different questions. But one of those comments got 60+ likes and this is where I want you to focus now\u0026hellip;\nThe Copywriter\u0026rsquo;s Comment So, the exact comment that I want you to look for is from a copywriter named Nico Sanchez. He is a copywriter who has a brand named \u0026ldquo;Copy Nomad\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; and I guess he has a good reputation and following\u0026hellip;\nHe purchased the $4.79 product and shared his experience in the comment:\n\u0026ldquo;initially bought this cause it it\u0026rsquo;s clearly an AC funnel\u0026hellip; gotta say as a copywriter with 10+ years experience I\u0026rsquo;m pleasantly surprised by the quality. Lots of stuff I use, but also great new stuff I want to implement.\u0026rdquo; - Nico Sanchez\nNothing fancy, he just shared his experience after purchasing the product. But see three other comments after his comment\u0026hellip; they purchased the product without overthinking\u0026hellip; one guy asked for his further opinion\u0026hellip;\nNow just consider the same case in the context of affiliate marketing. What if the company who advertised allows affiliate to promote their product for a commission? What if you become an affiliate of them\u0026hellip; how should you help people make a purchase decision?\nWhat Went Right? I want you always remember this ads and the copywriter\u0026rsquo;s comment to answer the question. Because it surely worked, naturally.

And you know by now that it is called Affilaite Marketing.\nIn affiliate marketing you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have your own product\u0026hellip;\nYou promote other peoples product\u0026hellip; and for each sale you get commission\u0026hellip;\nAlthough it is as simple as that I see most people still wonders \u0026ldquo;how can I start?\u0026rdquo;\nI will answer this topic in this post\u0026hellip;\nTo start affiliate marketing you have to know the answer of the following three questions, and I am giving you the questions and possible answer here in my post\u0026hellip;\nQ1. What affiliate products to choose? Answer: There are a lot of products to choose from and it won\u0026rsquo;t cost you a penny to become an affiliate of most products. Still I see a lot of newbies ask in different forums \u0026ldquo;how to get affiliate link to promote a product? On top of that there are affiliate marketplace like Clickbank, JVzoo, WarriorPlus, Digistore24 where you can find affiliate products to promote. The product you choose should be a good product that people will buy. Remember that every product has customers, but not every product sales equal. Find best selling products from those affiliate marketplaces or simply by searching on google with the following terms:\nTop 10 affiliate products to promote in (your interst area)\nI think you can find a lot of products to promote if you just remember these two\u0026hellip;\nQ2. Where and how to promote the product? Now I guess everyone has got a product\u0026rsquo;s affiliate link to promote. If you have got one, the second questions will be like, where and how to find people to promote my product, in other words, how to get traffic? This is a big question in itself. I would only touch two things here. A product can be promoted through paid advertising or free organic strategies. In affiliate marketing terms, it is called Traffic/Lead Generation. One thing you need to remember is that traffic is already there, you just need to find it. By saying this I mean people are using Facebook, Tiktok, Youtube, Email so they are the traffic already passing time online. But you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to reach them. This is where you have to put most of your focus once you have something to sale.\nQ3. How to make sale? Nowadays, with the prevalence of social media, it has become easier to find traffic than before. You can find targetted traffic in different interest groups, or through your contents with the help of algorithm and without spending anything on paid ads. But still you will struggle to make sale. Because, selling is an art. You need to master the art of selling. In affiliate marketing terms it is also called conversion or closing. Simply put the closing or convesion or sales process starts when you first introduce your paid products in front of the audience. The best affiliate marketers know the art of introducing their paid offers in front of their audience without appearing salesy. And it should be something you will need learn in your journey\u0026hellip;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for today. If you think you have got some clarity by reading this post, then I am happy to share that I have a clarity doc which is designed to give you more clarity and save your money.
