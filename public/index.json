[{"content":"In my previous post I discussed about my smartphone-friendly side hustle. And you know by now that it is called Affilaite Marketing.\nIn affiliate marketing you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have your own product\u0026hellip;\nYou promote other peoples product\u0026hellip; and for each sale you get commission\u0026hellip;\nAlthough it is as simple as that I see most people still wonders \u0026ldquo;how can I start?\u0026rdquo;\nI will answer this topic in this post\u0026hellip;\nTo start affiliate marketing you have to know the answer of the following three questions, and I am giving you the questions and possible answer here in my post\u0026hellip;\nQ1. What affiliate products to choose? Answer: There are a lot of products to choose from and it won\u0026rsquo;t cost you a penny to become an affiliate of most products. Still I see a lot of newbies ask in different forums \u0026ldquo;how to get affiliate link to promote a product? On top of that there are affiliate marketplace like Clickbank, JVzoo, WarriorPlus, Digistore24 where you can find affiliate products to promote. The product you choose should be a good product that people will buy. Remember that every product has customers, but not every product sales equal. Find best selling products from those affiliate marketplaces or simply by searching on google with the following terms:\nTop 10 affiliate products to promote in (your interst area)\nI think you can find a lot of products to promote if you just remember these two\u0026hellip;\nQ2. Where and how to promote the product? Now I guess everyone has got a product\u0026rsquo;s affiliate link to promote. If you have got one, the second questions will be like, where and how to find people to promote my product, in other words, how to get traffic? This is a big question in itself. I would only touch two things here. A product can be promoted through paid advertising or free organic strategies. In affiliate marketing terms, it is called Traffic/Lead Generation. One thing you need to remember is that traffic is already there, you just need to find it. By saying this I mean people are using Facebook, Tiktok, Youtube, Email so they are the traffic already passing time online. But you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to reach them. This is where you have to put most of your focus once you have something to sale.\nQ3. How to make sale? Nowadays, with the prevalence of social media, it has become easier to find traffic than before. You can find targetted traffic in different interest groups, or through your contents with the help of algorithm and without spending anything on paid ads. But still you will struggle to make sale. Because, selling is an art. You need to master the art of selling. In affiliate marketing terms it is also called conversion or closing. Simply put the closing or convesion or sales process starts when you first introduce your paid products in front of the audience. The best affiliate marketers know the art of introducing their paid offers in front of their audience without appearing salesy. And it should be something you will need learn in your journey\u0026hellip;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for today. If you think you have got some clarity by reading this post, then I am happy to share that I have a clarity doc which is designed to give you more clarity and save your money. If you are interested to read it, you can just go on top of the site and find the clarity doc from the menu bar.\n","permalink":"https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/learn/how_to_start_affiliate_marketing/","summary":"I have seen people asking me these 3 questions again and again when they start their affiliate marketing journey.
