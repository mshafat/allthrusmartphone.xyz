  <div class="post-content"><p>When someone starts online marketing,  traffic may be the first thing they struggle to understand for the first time&hellip; Soon they realize it is not the vehicles we used to see on roads&hellip;it is we people who are targeted to the offer or solution&hellip;</p>
<p>After traffic, lead generation comes into play&hellip;</p>
<p>The difference I see is not clearly understood by many&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="traffic-vs-lead">Traffic vs Lead<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#traffic-vs-lead">#</a></h2>
<p>So what is the difference between traffic and lead?</p>
<p>Traffic and lead both refers to people in online marketing&hellip;</p>
<p>But they are not the same, have a slight but crucial difference..</p>
<p><strong>Traffic is your target audience&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you have a diet pill for obese people, then all the obese people online are are your target people aka traffic</p>
<p>Now leads are also traffic but not all the traffic are leads&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Leads are only interested people to your offers&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>For example, you put your ads on somewhere your traffic hangs out which says you have got a pill that can help obese man and women lose 10 pounds in 30 days&hellip;</p>
<p>And you put the ads in a Weight Loss Facebook group&hellip;</p>
<p>That means all the people there are your target audience aka traffic as they joined the group with an intention to lose weight&hellip; If the group has 2000 members, all the 2000 people are your traffic&hellip;</p>
<p>But you got only 10 people interested in your offer&hellip;</p>
<p>So out of all the 2000 people you generated 10 leads who are interested in your offer&hellip;</p>
<p>I have written on this topic as I have been asked by many people that how to generate traffic&hellip;</p>
<p>The question is wrong in my opinion&hellip;</p>
<p>Traffic can&rsquo;t be generated, it is already there, you just need to found them&hellip;</p>
<p>Leads can be generated with proper ads and following proven strategies&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my take from these two terms&hellip;.</p>
<h2 id="selling-vs-closing">Selling vs Closing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#selling-vs-closing">#</a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Sell vs Close&hellip;</p>
<p>Primarily I also thought that both terms have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably&hellip;and I have seen many people use it interchangeably&hellip;.</p>
<p>But then I found that they are not the same&hellip; Again has a subtle but important distinction in between&hellip;</p>
<p>To understand the difference I would like to recall a quote from The wolf of wall street documentary&hellip; where you will hear the following Ben Affleck&rsquo;s quote (which is worth remembering btw):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sale is made on every call you make. Either you sell the client some stock or he sells you a reason he can&rsquo;t. Either way a sale is made, the only question is: Who is gonna close?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote should be understood in the context of cold calling&hellip;</p>
<p>If you understand the quote you know a sale can be made without paying anything, you can sell a concept, an idea, a promise, a perspective, a logic or a reason as well&hellip;and most important aspect here is that &ndash; selling is a process.</p>
<p><strong>If selling is a process, then closing is the final destination of the process</strong>&hellip;if you can sell an idea, a promise etc,  you can then close it by offering something irresistible to the lead&hellip;.this is how you close the sell&hellip;</p>
<p>But if you try to sell a big promise but the lead raises a bigger objection not to go for it&hellip;.you failed to handle the objection in selling process and you failed to close and the deal is closed by the lead instead without any monetary transaction&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="why-understanding-the-differences-is-crucial">Why understanding the differences is crucial?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-understanding-the-differences-is-crucial">#</a></h2>
<p>It is important to understand the differences otherwise you will struggle to prioritize your focus&hellip;</p>
<p>If you are just beginning focus on how to find traffic&hellip;</p>
<p>When you got a good traffic source just focus on lead generation&hellip;</p>
<p>If you become skilled at generating leads then focus more on how to sell your offer to them&hellip;</p>
<p>And if you find that your sales process taking too much time and effort and yielding less profits then surely there&rsquo;s something wrong in your closing part&hellip;it is time to become skilled at closing&hellip;.</p>
<p>So I think the above post was helpful to understand the differences between Traffic vs Leads, Sale vs Close &hellip;.</p>
