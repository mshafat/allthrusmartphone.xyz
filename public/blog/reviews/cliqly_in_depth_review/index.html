  "articleBody": " Update (17-08-23): Today, I got a VSL of a scam internet marketing business of 2019-2022. Bobby Jones were the owner of the program. The VSL script of that program matches exactly with Cliqly’s. I have downloaded it from Bobby Jone’s Vimeo account and uploaded it to my Youtube. So that the proof remains on the internet even if Bobby removes the video from his account.\nUpdate (06-01-24): It is 2024, and Cliqly is still scaming people. In last October 2023 Bobby started offering 60 days of coaching for $5400 to members. But people fail to ask question why things like this require even a coaching let alone high ticket? wasn’t it as easy as sending pre-written email? Where’s the catch? Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for payments and support is not responsive at all to their queries. But you won’t hear anything like that in Cliqly Official Facebook Group. Do you know why? Because it appears that the group automatically declines comments which include words “payment” and “support”. I can easily guess Bobby’s philosophy on payment and support from this single movement. What else you can expect?\nFinal Verdict: Cliqly is 200% scam. Stay away from it before it starts massive scamming.\nLast month I made a short review on Cliqly Email Marketing side hustle. After I pushlished that post I also shared it with some folks who are promoting Cliqly. I got mixed opinion. Some of them diagreed to my findings. They told me, the girl who’s case I reviewed started at the beginning of Cliqly, but Cliqly today is not what it was back then…\nBased on their feedback I realized that I have to review Cliqly once again, based on what’s currently going on there, this time I will take several examples before I give you my final thought… let’s start with the factsheet…\nFactsheet Name: Cliqly President: Bobby Jones Type: Investment Scheme Membership: FREE with Trial ($97 to upgrade) Trial Period: 5 days Upsells: Several What is Cliqly? According to Bobby Jones, Cliqly is doing email business. He said there are millions of people who opt-in to get offers on business opportunities etc. Cliqly is serving to those millions of people. But they can’t do it as email service providers won’t allow one single account to send billions of email to millions of subscribers list. So, they made the system where thousands of people like you and I can send email from small accounts and Cliqly shares a portion of their CPA (Cost Per Actions) commission with us. While doing my research I heard that Cliqly earns $0.35 per click into their CPA offers, and shares $0.10 with us. This is what Bobby Jones says about Cliqly. I am going to share my own opinion throughout this review.\nThe sales page video of Cliqly starts saying this:\n“Pay very close attention to every word in this video. I’m gonna walk you through the opportunity of a life-time to personally partner with me and start earning money immediately, all for free.”\nI have paid close attention to every word two times and tried to find the truth of those words. the guy talking in the video introduced himself as Gary… and he also introduced 3 other success stories of Cliqly which includes Bobby’s son Christian and daughter Devin. The 3rd one nammed Brittain, who is his friend’s sister… I looked all them up in Cliqly official group and through general Facebook search and couldn’t find anyone relevant, may be they have different names there, idk. But based on the sales video I am very confident that what Cliqly is claiming is not true at all.\nLet’s break it down a bit…\nClaim # 1: It is 100% and completely free to get started, so you can put your wallet away\nTruth: It is free to get started: You are given a 5-day trial after which you will have to pay $97 to continue… so if you put your wallet away… take it back…\nClaim # 2: Bobby has been working successfully online for 27 years\nTruth: I have got no trace of Bobby’s 27 years with google search, although he has a Clickfunnel Two Comma Club award. I got this Linkedin profile of Bobby Jones, but there is no photo, no information except “President at Cliqly.com”\nClaim # 3: It is completely real and completely free to get started\nTruth: So it is not completely free to get started, will talk more on that shortly…\nClaim # 4: Email service provider account is limited by bandwidth and how many people you can have in your list. Email service providers don’t want paying them to take all of their bandwidth and space sending billions and billions of emails every single month.\nTruth: You are just given an account inside Cliqly, not with an Email Service Provider. So no matter how many accounts Cliqly has inside, for Email Service Provider the account holder is Cliqly. Thus, the logic of bandwidth and space is lame in my opinion.\nClaim # 5: He would love to put all of this potential customers to one huge account and email them all, but email service providers just won’t let him, no matter how much he offers to pay them.\nTruth: It is true, but there’s another truth you need to know. People are averaging $5-15 by sending 75000 email each day. If I take $10 for average that means 100 clicks for 75000 email. The click rate is 0.13%. With such low click rate no Email Service Provider gonna let him do this business.\nClaim # 6: Bobby has written two books on Email Marketing.\nTruth: I have yet to find those 2 books Bobby written. Found 2 books co-authored by Bobby Jones on Amazon but the photo of the author I saw there is a black man’s who is clearly a different person.\nClaim # 7: Because of the enormous size of the email market, there’s no limit except for the fact that Bobby can only work with a limited number of people…\nTruth: This can be partially true that the size of email market is big, but there are rules of doing business there. You can’t spam offers to a list even if they have given their consent to do so. Because if your open rate and click rate is super low, no email service provider will allow you to keep sending emails for life. Interestingly Aweber started restricting accounts those are promoting Cliqly. So, I believe what Cliqly is saying and doing is further from truth.\nClaim # 8: Bobby wants you to partner with him. Notice “Parnter” not “Pay”. You would never pay him a single dime ever for any of his trainings and knowledge that he has aquired in last 27 years.\nTruth: A blatant lie. Bobby requires you to pay money or stay away.\nClaim # 9: In fact, he is gonna pay you. He will make money when you will make money.\nTruth: This is 100% true, he will make money when you will make money. The difference is you will need to pay him more than you payout…\nGetting started with Cliqly is FREE, but only for 5 days If you join Cliqly you will start with a 5-day FREE trial membership, where you will be given a 5000 email list to email. You can send email with Cliqly credits and there are two types of credits:\nCliqly list building credits: Whenever you send email with List Building Credits and someone opens your email that subscriber’s email will be added to your existing 5000 openers list. That means you are building your list by each open. You can send and schedule email in a batch of 20,000 and sending limit is 40,000 each day.\nCliqlyPro credits: When you signed up, you will be given a 5000 openers list and 500,000 CliqlyPro credits to send email to the list. With 1 credit you can send 1 email and it will earn you $0.10 when someone clicks on the link. You can send and schedule emails in batches of 5,000 and sending limit is 75,000 each day. Sending limits will increase with the upgrade of Tier. Will talk about the tier later on.\nIs Cliqly FREE? Because you are not providing your card details at the time of sign up, Cliqly won’t cost you anything to start, but you can’t actually go anywhere with this trial. You have to pay $97 to keep using it after the trial or you can’t withdraw your commission. With the purchase of $97 will give you an additional 500,000 CliqlyPro Credits and an additional 200,000 List Building credits. You have to keep purchasing these credits if you continue sending emails on a regular basis otherwise the credits will run out and your journey will stop.\nThreshold to withdraw commissions in Cliqly It is very important to note that paying $97 will make you eligible to withdraw your commission earned but there is another condition to be met to withdraw your commission – Minimum Threshold. The minimum threshhold of withdrawal is a whooping $300. So, untill you reach that threshold don’t think of seeing the commission in your bank account.\nCliqly tiers explained (Tier 1 to 10) Cliqly Tiers are based on how many subcribers or openers list you have and it is important because you can send more emails per day if you are in higher tier… here’s the Tier brakdowns:\nTier 1 (Openers List UP TO 30,000): Send upto 70,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 2 (Openers List OVER 30,000): Send upto 100,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 3 (Openers List OVER 70,000): Send upto 130,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 4 (Openers List OVER 100,000): Send upto 200,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 5 (Openers List OVER 150,000): Send upto 250,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 6 (Openers List OVER 250,000): Send upto 350,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 7 (Openers List OVER 350,000): Send upto 500,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 8 (Openers List OVER 500,000): Send upto 650,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 9 (Openers List OVER 700,000): Send upto 800,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro Tier 10 (Openers List OVER 900,000): Send upto 1,000,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro There are several upsells in Cliqly Aside from paying for credits, there are upsells and flash sells inside Cliqly, three of them are mentioned below:\nTier Jumper: Occaisionally they offer this upsell, where you can buy 10k, 25k, and 50k subscribers list and jump your tier.\nMyInboxPro: With MyInBoxPro you can send your own offer and write your own email. There are several packages. Starter package costs $97/month. With $97/month you can send 30,000 email each day to promote your own offer to your openers list.\nCo-Op: With Co-Op program Cliqly also promotes your affilites link and guarantees referral. Eg. It takes $197 to get 20 referrals.\nWhy the hype around Cliqly? So, with everything I have discussed above, the big question can be what’s the reason for the Cliqly hype lately, here’s the short answer: Affiliate Commission.\nCliqly affiliate commission If someone you referred to Cliqly upgrades with $97 you will get 100% commission of that. You will get 5% commission for fothcoming purchases of credits and other upsells. That’s all about the affiliate program so far. In fact, to me except the 100% commission of $97, the commission plan is not interesting at all.\nI have even a better opportunity which is completely free on front end and if you pay for special license you can receive 100% commission on all the current upsells.\nWho are the target customer of Cliqly? I have found some common characteristics of people who are using Cliqly:\nMost people who are using Cliqly are newbies to make money online Most of them don’t have any technical know-how to operate a business online Many of them don’t want to put the time and effort required when it comes to make money online Finally they have idle money to invest Cliqly has given a lot of these people the first hand experience to make money online. You start the trial, send the emails in 5 to 10 minutes and after 24 hours you see $5-15 in your account. Which has a great impact on people’s psychology to invest into the system.\nIs Cliqly a scam? If I consider the sales video, Cliqly is a total scam. But in terms of paying the eligible customers their commission, it is not a scam, at least not yet. But to be honest, I am highly skeptical of this business, it makes no sense to me and if my 6th sense is right Cliqly will stop paying sooner or later or FTC will ban the business.\nWho is Cliqly for? Cliqly is for you:\nIf you have never made money online, but want to get the feeling of it. If you are reluctant to learn high income skills to make money online. If you are not motivated to do income producing activity to run a real online business. If you have spere money to spend in a so called “easy” investment scheme with little work committment. If you have never heard of 100% commission online and are thinking it is only Cliqly which is offering this. If you are not like above, check out this learning opportunity which is free on front end and also gives you 100% commission on upsells with special license.\nThis is what I have found after talking with those who are using Cliqly? I have talked with a few folks in Cliqly, most of those people are not in profit with the system, a few of those are in profit. One guy is earning $1500 every week with the system. Putting them all together here are some key insights of it:\nThe list Cliqly is giving to people are only responsive inside the system Even if you email from Cliqly but you change the link containing in the pre-written email to your own offer, the click rate will suddenly fall down to zero. The click rate is down from July and August and Bobby said it is because of the summar time in US and because most people are spending their holiday. Those people who are using Cliqly for last 2 years said that “summar fall” didn’t happen last year, at least not in July and August. Other people reported no matter what time you spread your email to be sent, you always get the average clicks. This would not be the case if the list is US dominant. Bobby said he is giving $0.10 click commission out of kindness. This statement blows Email Service Providers logic out of the water. Some people who are using Cliqly started getting the mass generic pre-written email from other users and even their own email as well. It slightly proves that Cliqly is indeed delivering some of the emails, but how much and who’s? The support system of Cliqly is not responsive. You may have to email them several times to get a response. Finally one guy who is currently in profit with Cliqly (staying from the begining) gave a remark on Cliqly list building and I think the same remark applies to Cliqly in general – “it is just another game of chance”. Final thought Cliqly is not an email marketing business. It is just an investment scheme in disguise of email marketing or CPA marketing. It feels more like a Ponzy scheme which is defined as: A form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.\nMy recommendation For obvious reasons, I can’t recommend and promote Cliqly although I know it is easier to sell this type of opportunity to a large pool of audience. I like to make money by helping people, recommending people what is good for them. And if you think the above review was helpful in some way, then I must have done something right. What I’m doing is affiliate marketing, and if you need more clarity on how to do it the right way, check my clarity doc from the top menu bar of this site.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><blockquote>
<p><strong>Update (17-08-23):</strong> Today, I got a VSL of a scam internet marketing business of 2019-2022. Bobby Jones were the owner of the program. The VSL script of that program matches exactly with Cliqly&rsquo;s. I have downloaded it from <a href="https://vimeo.com/337378317?fbclid=IwAR2TdcEPj3BcVBii15aNvyMsgj8QYHiAS_XtxpzKv0x_Bor96-u0DEL6vsY">Bobby Jone&rsquo;s Vimeo account</a> and uploaded it to <a href="https://youtu.be/LMpxKp9dTgk">my Youtube</a>. So that the proof remains on the internet even if Bobby removes the video from his account.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update (06-01-24):</strong> It is 2024, and Cliqly is still scaming people. In last October 2023 Bobby started offering 60 days of coaching for $5400 to members. But people fail to ask question why things like this require even a coaching let alone high ticket? wasn&rsquo;t it as easy as sending pre-written email? Where&rsquo;s the catch? Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for payments and support is not responsive at all to their queries. But you won&rsquo;t hear anything like that in Cliqly Official Facebook Group. Do you know why? Because it appears that the group automatically declines comments which include words &ldquo;payment&rdquo; and &ldquo;support&rdquo;. I can easily guess Bobby&rsquo;s philosophy on payment and support from this single movement. What else you can expect?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Final Verdict:</strong> Cliqly is 200% scam. Stay away from it before it starts massive scamming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last month I made <a href="https://allthrusmartphone.xyz/blog/reviews/cliqly_review/">a short review</a> on Cliqly Email Marketing side hustle. After I pushlished that post I also shared it with some folks who are promoting Cliqly. I got mixed opinion. Some of them diagreed to my findings. They told me, the girl who&rsquo;s case I reviewed started at the beginning of Cliqly, but Cliqly today is not what it was back then&hellip;</p>
<p>Based on their feedback I realized that I have to review Cliqly once again, based on what&rsquo;s currently going on there, this time I will take several examples before I give you my final thought&hellip; let&rsquo;s start with the factsheet&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="factsheet">Factsheet<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#factsheet">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Name: Cliqly</li>
<li>President: Bobby Jones</li>
<li>Type: Investment Scheme</li>
<li>Membership: FREE with Trial ($97 to upgrade)</li>
<li>Trial Period: 5 days</li>
<li>Upsells: Several</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-cliqly">What is Cliqly?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-cliqly">#</a></h2>
<p>According to Bobby Jones, Cliqly is doing email business. He said there are millions of people who opt-in to get offers on business opportunities etc. Cliqly is serving to those millions of people. But they can&rsquo;t do it as email service providers won&rsquo;t allow one single account to send billions of email to millions of subscribers list. So, they made the system where thousands of people like you and I can send email from small accounts and Cliqly shares a portion of their CPA (Cost Per Actions) commission with us. While doing my research I heard that Cliqly earns $0.35 per click into their CPA offers, and shares $0.10 with us. This is what Bobby Jones says about Cliqly. I am going to share my own opinion throughout this review.</p>
<p>The sales page video of Cliqly starts saying this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pay very close attention to every word in this video. I&rsquo;m gonna walk you through the opportunity of a life-time to personally partner with me and start earning money immediately, all for free.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have paid close attention to every word two times and tried to find the truth of those words. the guy talking in the video introduced himself as Gary&hellip; and he also introduced 3 other success stories of Cliqly which includes Bobby&rsquo;s son Christian and daughter Devin. The 3rd one nammed Brittain, who is his friend&rsquo;s sister&hellip; I looked all them up in Cliqly official group and through general Facebook search and couldn&rsquo;t find anyone relevant, may be they have different names there, idk. But based on the sales video I am very confident that what Cliqly is claiming is not true at all.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break it down a bit&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 1:</strong> It is 100% and completely free to get started, so you can put your wallet away</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> It is free to get started: You are given a 5-day trial after which you will have to pay $97 to continue&hellip; so if you put your wallet away&hellip; take it back&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 2:</strong> Bobby has been working successfully online for 27 years</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> I have got no trace of Bobby&rsquo;s 27 years with google search, although he has a Clickfunnel Two Comma Club award. I got <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobby-jones-916b3b1aa/">this Linkedin profile of Bobby Jones</a>, but there is no photo, no information except &ldquo;President at Cliqly.com&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 3:</strong> It is completely real and completely free to get started</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> So it is not completely free to get started, will talk more on that shortly&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 4:</strong> Email service provider account is limited by bandwidth and how many people you can have in your list. Email service providers don&rsquo;t want paying them to take all of their bandwidth and space sending billions and billions of emails every single month.</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> You are just given an account inside Cliqly, not with an Email Service Provider. So no matter how many accounts Cliqly has inside, for Email Service Provider the account holder is Cliqly. Thus, the logic of bandwidth and space is lame in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 5:</strong> He would love to put all of this potential customers to one huge account and email them all, but email service providers just won&rsquo;t let him, no matter how much he offers to pay them.</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> It is true, but there&rsquo;s another truth you need to know. People are averaging $5-15 by sending 75000 email each day. If I take $10 for average that means 100 clicks for 75000 email. The click rate is 0.13%. With such low click rate no Email Service Provider gonna let him do this business.</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 6:</strong> Bobby has written two books on Email Marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> I have yet to find those 2 books Bobby written. Found 2 books co-authored by Bobby Jones on Amazon but the photo of the author I saw there is a black man&rsquo;s who is clearly a different person.</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 7:</strong> Because of the enormous size of the email market, there&rsquo;s no limit except for the fact that Bobby can only work with a limited number of people&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> This can be partially true that the size of email market is big, but there are rules of doing business there. You can&rsquo;t spam offers to a list even if they have given their consent to do so. Because if your open rate and click rate is super low, no email service provider will allow you to keep sending emails for life. Interestingly Aweber started restricting accounts those are promoting Cliqly. So, I believe what Cliqly is saying and doing is further from truth.</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 8:</strong> Bobby wants you to partner with him. Notice &ldquo;Parnter&rdquo; not &ldquo;Pay&rdquo;. You would never pay him a single dime ever for any of his trainings and knowledge that he has aquired in last 27 years.</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> A blatant lie. Bobby requires you to pay money or stay away.</p>
<p><strong>Claim # 9:</strong> In fact, he is gonna pay you. He will make money when you will make money.</p>
<p><strong>Truth:</strong> This is 100% true, he will make money when you will make money. The difference is you will need to pay him more than you payout&hellip;</p>

</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-cliqly-is-free-but-only-for-5-days">Getting started with Cliqly is FREE, but only for 5 days<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#getting-started-with-cliqly-is-free-but-only-for-5-days">#</a></h2>
<p>If you join Cliqly you will start with a 5-day FREE trial membership, where you will be given a 5000 email list to email. You can send email with Cliqly credits and there are two types of credits:</p>
<p><strong>Cliqly list building credits:</strong>
Whenever you send email with List Building Credits and someone opens your email that subscriber&rsquo;s email will be added to your existing 5000 openers list. That means you are building your list by each open. You can send and schedule email in a batch of 20,000 and sending limit is 40,000 each day.</p>
<p><strong>CliqlyPro credits:</strong>
When you signed up, you will be given a 5000 openers list and 500,000 CliqlyPro credits to send email to the list. With 1 credit you can send 1 email and it will earn you $0.10 when someone clicks on the link. You can send and schedule emails in  batches of 5,000 and sending limit is 75,000 each day. Sending limits will increase with the upgrade of Tier. Will talk about the tier later on.</p>
<h2 id="is-cliqly-free">Is Cliqly FREE?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-cliqly-free">#</a></h2>
<p>Because you are not providing your card details at the time of sign up, Cliqly won&rsquo;t cost you anything to start, but you can&rsquo;t actually go anywhere with this trial. You have to pay $97 to keep using it after the trial or you can&rsquo;t withdraw your commission. With the purchase of $97 will give you an additional 500,000 CliqlyPro Credits and an additional 200,000 List Building credits. You have to keep purchasing these credits if you continue sending emails on a regular basis otherwise the credits will run out and your journey will stop.</p>
<h2 id="threshold-to-withdraw-commissions-in-cliqly">Threshold to withdraw commissions in Cliqly<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#threshold-to-withdraw-commissions-in-cliqly">#</a></h2>
<p>It is very important to note that paying $97 will make you eligible to withdraw your commission earned but there is another condition to be met to withdraw your commission &ndash; Minimum Threshold. The minimum threshhold of withdrawal is a whooping $300. So, untill you reach that threshold don&rsquo;t think of seeing the commission in your bank account.</p>

<p>Cliqly Tiers are based on how many subcribers or openers list you have and it is important because you can send more emails per day if you are in higher tier&hellip; here&rsquo;s the Tier brakdowns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 (Openers List UP TO 30,000): Send upto 70,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 2 (Openers List OVER 30,000): Send upto 100,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 3 (Openers List OVER 70,000): Send upto 130,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 4 (Openers List OVER 100,000): Send upto 200,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 5 (Openers List OVER 150,000): Send upto 250,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 6 (Openers List OVER 250,000): Send upto 350,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 7 (Openers List OVER 350,000): Send upto 500,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 8 (Openers List OVER 500,000): Send upto 650,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 9 (Openers List OVER 700,000): Send upto 800,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
<li>Tier 10 (Openers List OVER 900,000): Send upto 1,000,000 emails a day in CliqlyPro</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="there-are-several-upsells-in-cliqly">There are several upsells in Cliqly<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#there-are-several-upsells-in-cliqly">#</a></h2>
<p>Aside from paying for credits, there are upsells and flash sells inside Cliqly, three of them are mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Tier Jumper:</strong> Occaisionally they offer this upsell, where you can buy 10k, 25k, and 50k subscribers list and jump your tier.</p>
<p><strong>MyInboxPro:</strong> With MyInBoxPro you can send your own offer and write your own email. There are several packages. Starter package costs $97/month. With $97/month you can send 30,000 email each day to promote your own offer to your openers list.</p>
<p><strong>Co-Op:</strong> With Co-Op program Cliqly also promotes your affilites link and guarantees referral. Eg. It takes $197 to get 20 referrals.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-hype-around-cliqly">Why the hype around Cliqly?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-the-hype-around-cliqly">#</a></h2>
<p>So, with everything I have discussed above, the big question can be what&rsquo;s the reason for the Cliqly hype lately, here&rsquo;s the short answer: Affiliate Commission.</p>
<h2 id="cliqly-affiliate-commission">Cliqly affiliate commission<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cliqly-affiliate-commission">#</a></h2>
<p>If someone you referred to Cliqly upgrades with $97 you will get 100% commission of that. You will get 5% commission for fothcoming purchases of credits and other upsells. That&rsquo;s all about the affiliate program so far. In fact, to me except the 100% commission of $97, the commission plan is not interesting at all.</p>
<p>I have even <a href="https://lazycommissions.com/shafat">a better opportunity</a> which is <em>completely</em> free on front end and if you pay for special license you can receive 100% commission on all the current upsells.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-the-target-customer-of-cliqly">Who are the target customer of Cliqly?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-are-the-target-customer-of-cliqly">#</a></h2>
<p>I have found some common characteristics of people who are using Cliqly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people who are using Cliqly are newbies to make money online</li>
<li>Most of them don&rsquo;t have any technical know-how to operate a business online</li>
<li>Many of them don&rsquo;t want to put the time and effort required when it comes to make money online</li>
<li>Finally they have idle money to invest</li>
</ul>
<p>Cliqly has given a lot of these people the first hand experience to make money online. You start the trial, send the emails in 5 to 10 minutes and after 24 hours you see $5-15 in your account. Which has a great impact on people&rsquo;s psychology to invest into the system.</p>
<h2 id="is-cliqly-a-scam">Is Cliqly a scam?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-cliqly-a-scam">#</a></h2>
<p>If I consider the sales video, Cliqly is a total scam. But in terms of paying the eligible customers their commission, it is not a scam, at least not yet. But to be honest, I am highly skeptical of this business, it makes no sense to me and if my 6th sense is right Cliqly will stop paying sooner or later or FTC will ban the business.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-cliqly-for">Who is Cliqly for?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-is-cliqly-for">#</a></h2>
<p>Cliqly is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have never made money online, but want to get the feeling of it.</li>
<li>If you are reluctant to learn high income skills to make money online.</li>
<li>If you are not motivated to do income producing activity to run a real online business.</li>
<li>If you have spere money to spend in a so called &ldquo;easy&rdquo; investment scheme with little work committment.</li>
<li>If you have never heard of 100% commission online and are thinking it is only Cliqly which is offering this.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not like above, <a href="https://lazycommissions.com/shafat">check out this learning opportunity</a> which is free on front end and also gives you 100% commission on upsells with special license.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-what-i-have-found-after-talking-with-those-who-are-using-cliqly">This is what I have found after talking with those who are using Cliqly?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-is-what-i-have-found-after-talking-with-those-who-are-using-cliqly">#</a></h2>
<p>I have talked with a few folks in Cliqly, most of those people are not in profit with the system, a few of those are in profit. One guy is earning $1500 every week with the system. Putting them all together here are some key insights of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list Cliqly is giving to people are only responsive inside the system</li>
<li>Even if you email from Cliqly but you change the link containing in the pre-written email to your own offer, the click rate will suddenly fall down to zero.</li>
<li>The click rate is down from July and August and Bobby said it is because of the summar time in US and because most people are spending their holiday.</li>
<li>Those people who are using Cliqly for last 2 years said that &ldquo;summar fall&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t happen last year, at least not in July and August.</li>
<li>Other people reported no matter what time you spread your email to be sent, you always get the average clicks. This would not be the case if the list is US dominant.</li>
<li>Bobby said he is giving $0.10 click commission out of kindness. This statement blows Email Service Providers logic out of the water.</li>
<li>Some people who are using Cliqly started getting the mass generic pre-written email from other users and even their own email as well. It slightly proves that Cliqly is indeed delivering some of the emails, but how much and who&rsquo;s?</li>
<li>The support system of Cliqly is not responsive. You may have to email them several times to get a response.
<img loading="lazy" src="/images/photos/cliqly_support.jpeg" alt="Cliqly support"  title="cliqly support is not responsive for weeks sometimes"  />
</li>
<li>Finally one guy who is currently in profit with Cliqly (staying from the begining) gave a remark on Cliqly list building and I think the same remark applies to Cliqly in general &ndash; &ldquo;it is just another game of chance&rdquo;.</li>

<p>Cliqly is not an email marketing business. It is just an investment scheme in disguise of email marketing or CPA marketing. It feels more like a Ponzy scheme which is defined as:
A form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.</p>
<h2 id="my-recommendation">My recommendation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-recommendation">#</a></h2>
<p>For obvious reasons, I can&rsquo;t recommend and promote Cliqly although I know it is easier to sell this type of opportunity to a large pool of audience. I like to make money by helping people, recommending people what is good for them. And if you think the above review was helpful in some way, then I must have done something right. What I&rsquo;m doing is affiliate marketing, and if you need more clarity on how to do it the right way, check my <code>clarity doc</code> from the top menu bar of this site.</p>
